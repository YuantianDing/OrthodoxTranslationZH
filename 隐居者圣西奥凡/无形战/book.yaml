      en: In 1729 the word «Methodist» was first used; 90 years before, American Baptists
        had gathered for the first time. This was still 100 years before the world
        would hear the name of Joseph Smith, and many disillusioned Protestants in
        both Europe and America were beginning to seek a revival of faith, As opposed
        to the comparatively recent birth of these new sects, the long line of Holy
        Fathers and teachers of the Orthodox Church had at that time already spanned
        17 centuries, and it was in this year of 1729 that Almighty God raised up
        yet another who was to be numbered among the ranks of bright luminaries of
        the Church. Born on the island of Naxos, Greece, and educated at Smyrna, this
        Father and Saint went to the Holy Mountain of Athos at the age of 27, where
        he became a monk and received the name of Nicedemos.
      cn: '1729年，「循道宗」一词首次被使用；在此九十年前，美国浸信会的信徒们首次聚集。而这又比世人听闻约瑟夫·史密斯之名早了整整一百年。当时，欧美许多幻灭的新教徒开始寻求信仰的复兴。


        与这些新兴宗派相对而言，圣正教会的圣教父和导师们源远流长，当时已绵延十七个世纪。正是在这1729年，全能之神兴起了另一位将名列于教会璀璨群星中的人物。这位圣父在希腊纳克索斯岛出生，于士麦那接受教育。二十七岁时，他前往圣山阿索斯，在那里成为一名修士，并受名为尼哥底母。'

      en: St. Nicedemos undertook the struggle of writing about divine things. As
        one biographer said, «it is impossible to keep account of his fatigue and
        sweat in the labors which enabled him to beautify his' soul and capture in
        his books the fragrance of the Holy Spirit.»
      cn: 圣尼哥底母着手撰述神圣之事。正如一位传记作者所言：「他为美化灵魂、并在书卷中捕捉圣灵芬芳所付出的辛劳与汗水，实难以计量。」

      en: His most famous labour was helping St. Makarios of Corinth to select, edit,
        and prepare for publication the Philokalia, a collection of writings of Holy
        Fathers On what St. Nikodemos Called the «mystical school of inward prayer.
        The. word Philokalia means «love of good」, a fitting title for Writings that
        speak of how to live in Jesus Christ. The Philokalia appeared at the very
        time the French Revolution had begun to flood the world with hatred for anything
        godly.
      cn: 他最著名的工作是协助科林斯的圣马卡里奥斯选辑、编辑并预备出版《爱善集》（Philokalia）。这部集子收录了众圣教父关于圣尼哥德慕所称的「内修祈祷的奥秘学派」的著作。Philokalia这个词语意为「爱善」，这正是一个恰如其分的标题，因为这些著作论及如何在耶稣基督里生活。《爱善集》问世之时，法国大革命正开始以对一切神圣事物的仇恨席卷世界。

    text:
      en: Large parts of the Philokalia have been translated into English; however,
        it must be said that these writings are not for the beginner, nor even for
        the average Orthodox Christian. There is even a danger in their being read
        «out of season» and without proper guidance. More appropriate, and wonderfully
        useful, is the Saint''s superb work, Unseen Warfare. This book, originally
        published in Italy in 1589, was translated and many times enlarged by the
        Saint. The present English translation* is from the edition of the great 19th
        century Russian Holy Father, Theophan the Recluse.
      cn: 《爱典集》的许多篇章已被译为英文，然而，必须坦承，这些著述并非为初学者所预备，甚至对于普通的正教信徒亦非如此。若「不合时宜」地阅读，且缺乏适当的指导，其中甚至蕴含着危险。更为适宜且极有助益的，是这位圣人那部卓越的著作——《看不见的争战》。此书初版于一五八九年的意大利，后经这位圣人翻译并多次增补。现行的英译本\*乃是根据十九世纪伟大的俄罗斯圣父，隐修者狄奥梵所修订的版本翻译而来。

      en: 'The whole purpose of Unseen Warfare is to give the Orthodox Christian teaching
        concerning perfection in virtue and the «unseen warfare» necessary to accomplish
        this: «I will tell you plainly: the greatest and most perfect thing a man
        may desire to attain is to come near to God and dwell in union with Him.'
      cn: 《隐秘争战》的全部宗旨，在于提供东正教关于德性圆满及实现此目标的「隐秘争战」的教导：「我将清楚地告诉你：人所能渴望达成的最大、最圆满之事，莫过于亲近上帝，并与祂联合同住。

        fasts, vigils, genuflexions, sleeping on bare earth and other similar austerities
        of the body. Others say that it consists in saying many prayers at home and
        in attending long services in church. And there are others who think that
        our perfection consists entirely in mental prayer, solitude, seclusion and
        silence. But the majority limit perfection to a strict observance of all the
        rules and practices laid down by the statutes, falling into no excess or deficiency,
        but preserving a golden moderation. Yet all these virtues do not by themselves
        constitute the Christian perfection we are seeking, but are only a means and
        a method for acquiring it.
      cn: 有许多人声称，基督徒生命的完美在于禁食、守夜、跪拜、卧于裸地以及其他类似的身体苦行。另一些人则认为，它在于在家中多次祷告，并参与教堂里冗长的礼拜。还有一些人则以为，我们的完美全然在于心祷、独处、隐遁和静默。但大多数人将完美局限于严格遵守章程所规定的一切规条和实践，不逾矩亦不匮乏，而是持守着黄金般的中道。然而，所有这些美德，其本身并不能构成我们所寻求的基督徒之完美，而仅仅是获得它的一种方式和方法。

        and union with Him, as was said in the beginning. With this is connected a
        heartfelt realization of the goodness and greatness of God, together with
        the consciousness of our own nothingness and our proneness to every evil ....
        This is the law of love, inscribed by the finger of God Himself in the hearts
        of His true servants ! This is the renunciation of ourselves that God demands
        of us! This is the blessed yoke of Jesus Christ and His burden that is light!
        This is the submission to God''s will, which our Redeemer and Teacher demands
        from us both by His word and by His example !
      cn: 「你必须明白，完全无他，只在于亲近上帝并与祂合一，正如开篇所述。与此相连的，是对上帝的良善与伟大发自内心的体悟，以及对我们自身虚无与易倾向诸恶的觉知……这是爱的律法，由上帝的指头亲自铭刻在祂忠实仆人的心间！这是上帝要求我们舍弃自我的表现！这是耶稣基督那蒙福的轭，以及祂轻省的担子！这是顺服上帝的旨意，我们的救赎者和导师不仅以言语，更以祂的榜样，如此要求我们！」

        to reach the height of such perfection. Blessed be your zeal! But prepare
        yourself also for labor, sweat and struggle from your first steps on the path.
        You must sacrifice everything to God and do only His will. Yet you will meet
        in yourself as many wills as you have powers and wants. Therefore, to reach
        your desired aim, it is first of all necessary to stifle your own wills and
        finally to extinguish and kill them altogether. And in order to succeed in
        this, you must constantly oppose all evil in yourself and urge yourself towards
        good. In other words, you must ceaselessly fight against yourself and against
        everything that panders to your own wills, that incites and supports them.
        So prepare yourself for this struggle and this warfare and know that the crown--attainment
        of your desired aim--is given to none except to the valiant among warriors
        and wrestlers.
      cn: 「弟兄啊，你现在可明白这一切的深意了？我想你一定渴望达到这等完善的境界。愿你的热忱蒙受祝福！然而，从你踏上这条道路的第一步起，也要为劳苦、汗水和争战做好准备。你必须将一切献给上帝，只遵行祂的旨意。然而，你会发现自己内在有与你力量和欲望同样多的意志。因此，要达到你渴望的目标，首先必须压制你自己的意志，最终将其完全熄灭和杀死。为了成功做到这一点，你必须不断抵制自己内在的一切邪恶，并督促自己趋向良善。换言之，你必须不停地与自己争战，与一切迎合你自身意志、煽动和支持它们的事物争战。所以，请为这场争战和这场搏斗做好准备，并且要明白，那冠冕——即达到你渴望的目标——只赐予那些在勇士和摔跤手中最英勇的人。

        more tired he becomes; but on the way of spiritual life the longer a man travels,
        reaching forth unto those things which are before, the greater the strength
        and power he acquires for his further progress.»

        en: 'We all naturally wish, and are commanded to be perfect. The Lord commands:
          「Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect」
          (Matt v. 48). And St. Paul admonishes: 『In malice be ye children, but in
          understanding be men」 (I Cor. xiv. 20). In another place he says: 『Stand
          perfect and complete in all the will of God」 (Col. iv. 12); and again: 『Let
          us go on unto perfection』 (Heb. vi. 1). The same commandment is also found
          in the Old Testament. Thus God says to Israel in Deuteronomy: 『Thou shalt
          be perfect with the Lord thy God』 (Deut. xviii. 13). And David advises his
          son Solomon: 『And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father,
          and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind』 (I Chron. xxviii.
          9). After all this we cannot fail to see that God demands from Christians
          the fullness of perfection, that is, that we should be perfect in all virtues.'
        cn: 我们所有人自然而然地渴望并被命令要变得完全。主命令道：「所以你们要完全，正如你们的天父是完全的」（马太福音 5:48）。圣保罗劝诫说：「在恶事上你们要做婴孩，在心志上你们总要做大人」（哥林多前书
          14:20）。在另一个地方他说：「在上帝一切的旨意上，得以站立得稳，完备而充足」（歌罗西书 4:12）；又说：「让我们迈向成熟与完全」（希伯来书
          6:1）。同样的诫命也出现在旧约中。因此，上帝在申命记中对以色列说：「你要在上主你的上帝面前作完全人」（申命记 18:13）。大卫也劝告他的儿子所罗门说：「我儿所罗门哪，你当认识你父亲的上帝，全心乐意地事奉他」（历代志上
          28:9）。经过这一切，我们不能不明白，上帝要求基督徒达到完全的丰盛，也就是说，我们应该在一切美德上都臻于完善。

        en: 'There is no doubt whatever that they do represent means and effective
          means for attaining perfection in Christian life. For we see very many virtuous
          men, who practise these virtues as they should, to acquire strength and
          power against their own sinful and evil nature,-to gain, through these practices,
          courage to withstand the temptations and seductions of our three main enemies:
          the flesh, the world and the devil; and in and by these means to obtain
          the spiritual supports, so necessary to all servants of God, and especially
          to beginners. They fast, to subdue their unruly flesh; they practise vigils
          to sharpen their inner vision; they sleep on bare earth, lest they become
          soft through sleep; they bind their tongue by silence and go into solitude
          to avoid the slightest inducement to offend against the All-Holy God; they
          recite prayers, attend Church services and perform other acts of devotion,
          to keep their mind on heavenly things; they read of the life and passion
          of our Lord, for the sole purpose of realising more clearly their own deficiency
          and the merciful loving-kindness of God,-to learn and to desire to follow
          the Lord Jesus Christ, bearing their cross with self-denial, and to make
          more and more ardent their love of God and their dislike of themselves.'
        cn: 毫无疑问，它们确实是基督徒生命中达致完美的途径，并且是有效的途径。因为我们看到许多品德高尚的人，他们以应有的方式实践这些美德，以此获得力量和权能，以对抗他们自身罪恶和邪恶的本性——通过这些实践，获得勇气去抵御我们三大主要敌人：肉体、世界和魔鬼的诱惑和迷惑；并籍着这些途径，获得所有神的仆人，特别是初学者所极其需要的属灵支持。他们禁食，以制伏他们不受管束的肉体；他们守夜，以磨砺他们内在的洞察力；他们睡卧于裸露的大地，以免因睡眠而变得娇弱；他们以静默束缚舌头，并进入独处，以避免丝毫触犯至圣上帝的诱因；他们诵念祷文，参与教会礼仪，并进行其他虔敬的行为，以使他们的心专注于属天之事；他们阅读我主生平与受难的记载，其唯一目的便是更清楚地认识到自身的不足和上帝怜悯的慈爱——学习并渴望跟随主耶稣基督，背负着自己的十字架，否认自我，并使他们对上帝的爱和对自己的厌恶日渐炽烈。

          omission, to those who take them as the sole basis of their life and their
          hope; not from their nature, since they are righteous and holy, but through
          the fault of those, who use them not as they should be used; that is, when
          they pay attention only to the external practice of those virtues, and leave
          their heart to be moved by their own volitions and the volitions of the
          devil. For the latter, seeing that they have left the right path, gleefully
          refrains from interfering with their physical endeavours and even allows
          them to increase and multiply their efforts, in obedience to their own vain
          thought. Experiencing with this certain spiritual stirrings and consolations,
          such people begin to imagine that they have already reached the state of
          angels and feel that God Himself is present in them. And at times, engrossed
          in the contemplation of some abstract and unearthly things, they imagine
          that they have completely transcended the sphere of this world and have
          been ravished to the third heaven.
        cn: 另一方面，这些美德若被那些仅以此为生命与希望之基石者所奉行，其所造之害，或甚于公然弃绝。此非因美德之性，盖其本为公义圣洁；乃因奉行者之过失，未能以其当用之方式用之。此即，当他们仅关注美德之表象实践，而任其内心受自身意愿与魔鬼意愿所牵引。魔鬼见其已偏离正道，便欣然不乐地不再阻挠其肉体之努力，甚至允许其在虚妄之思的驱使下，加增并倍添其勤恳。这些人伴随着某些属灵的悸动与慰藉，便开始臆想自己已达天使之境，并自觉上帝亲自临在于他们之中。有时，他们全神贯注于某些抽象而超凡之物的默观，便想象自己已然完全超越此世之领域，并被提到三层天上。

          far they are from true perfection, if he looks at their life and character.

          according to their own will and are always stubborn in their decisions;
          they are blind in everything relating to themselves, but are very clear-sighted
          and officious in examining the words and actions of others. If another man
          is held by others in the same esteem, which in their opinion they enjoy,
          they cannot bear it and become manifestly hostile towards him; if anyone
          interferes with them in their pious occupations and works of asceticism,
          especially in the presence of others,-God forbid! -they immediately become
          indignant, boil over with wrath and become quite unlike themselves.

          be your zeal! But prepare yourself also for labour, sweat and struggle from
          your first steps on the path. You must sacrifice everything to God and do
          only His will. Yet you will meet in yourself as many wills as you have powers
          and wants, which all clamour for satisfaction, irrespective of whether it
          is in accordance with the will of God or not. Therefore, to reach your desired
          aim, it is first of all necessary to stifle your own wills and finally to
          extinguish and kill them altogether. And in order to succeed in this, you
          must constantly oppose all evil in yourself and urge yourself towards good.
          In other words, you must ceaselessly fight against yourself and against
          everything that panders to your own wills, that incites and supports them.
          So prepare 「yourself for this struggle and this warfare and know that the
          crown-attainment of your desired aim-is given to none except to the valiant

          in it is the most glorious of all; and, what is the main thing, it is most
          pleasing to God. For if, inspired by fervour, you overcome and put to death
          your unruly passions, your lusts and wills, you will please God more, and
          will work for Him more beautifully, than if you flog yourself till you draw
          blood or exhaust yourself by fasts more than any ancient hermit of the desert.

          and with whatever effort and sacrifice you may accomplish it, it will not
          lead you to your desired aim, if you leave your passions without attention,

          he is afflicted by some ill-fortune, tribulation or sorrow, and especially
          a grievous and long-drawn bodily sickness, he must understand that he suffers
          this in order to acquire self-knowledge, namely the knowledge of his weakness-and
          to become humble. With this purpose and to this end God allows us to be
          assailed by all kinds of temptations from the devil, from men and from our
          own corrupted nature. St. Paul saw this purpose in the temptations he suffered
          in Asia, when he said: 『•』But we had the sentence of death in ourselves,
          that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth dead』 (II

          what he said, what he did. He will undoubtedly find that the greater part
          of his thoughts, words and actions were sinful, wrong, foolish and bad.
          This experiment will make him understand in practice how inharmonious and
          weak he is in himself. And if he sincerely wishes himself well, this understanding

          But in practice it is not so. They can ascertain it for themselves, if they
          judge by what is in them and what happens to them if they fall down. If,
          when they grieve at their downfall, reproaching and abusing themselves for

          will be effaced and all will be well once more,」 this is a sure sign that
          before the downfall they trusted themselves, instead of trusting God. And
          the more gloomy and disconsolate their grief, the more it shows that they
          relied too much on themselves and too little on God; and therefore the grief
          caused by their downfall is not tempered by any comfort. If a man does not
          rely on himself but puts his trust in God, when he falls he is not greatly.
          surprised and is not overcome with excessive grief, for he knows that it
          is the result of his own impotence, and, above all, of the weakness of his
          trust in God, So his downfall increases his distrust of himself and makes
          him try all the harder to increase and deepen his humble trust in God. And
          further, hating the vile passions which caused his downfall, he thereupon
          endures peacefully and calmly the labours of penitence for having offended
          God; and armed with still more trust in God, he thereupon pursues his enemies

          old and strong or new and weak. Yet He has His own time and order for everything.
          Therefore if a soul be overburdened with sins, if it be guilty of all the

          unceasing struggle. /God is always ready with remedies for those struck

        en: If disbelief in oneself and trust in God, so indispensable in our spiritual
          warfare, remain alone in us, not only shall we never gain victory, but we
          shall fall into still greater evil. For in addition and accompanying them
          we must practise works of a special kind and perform exercises in spiritual
          instruction. First among these must be exercises of mind and will. The mind
          should be freed and guarded from ignorance, which is most harmful, for it
          darkens the mind and prevents it from knowing the truth, which is its proper
          object and the aim of its aspirations. For this reason it should be exercised,
          to make it clear and lucid, able to discern correctly what we need to purify
          our soul from passions and to adorn it with virtues.
        cn: 如果在我们属灵争战中不可或缺的对自己的不信和对上帝的信赖，只单独存在于我们里面，我们不仅永远无法获胜，反而会陷入更大的邪恶。因为除了它们之外，我们还必须实践一种特殊的善工，并进行属灵教导的操练。其中首要的必须是心思和意志的操练。心思应当从最有害的无知中被释放和守护，因为无知会蒙蔽心思，使其无法认识真理，而真理正是心思的固有对象和其渴望的目标。因此，心思应当被操练，使其清明透彻，能够正确辨别我们需要什么来洁净我们的灵魂脱离情欲，并以美德来妆饰它。

          first and most necessary is prayer, by which we must implore the Holy Spirit
          to pour His divine light into our hearts. This He will surely do, if we
          truly seek God alone and sincerely strive to obey His will in everything,
          willingly submitting in all affairs to the advice of our experienced spiritual
          fathers and doing nothing without asking them.'

        en: The second method of exercising the mind is always to examine things and
          probe deep for knowledge of them, in order to see clearly which of them
          are good and which bad.. We should judge them not as the world and the senses
          do, but as they are judged by right season and the Holy Spirit, or by the
          word of the divinely-inspired Scriptures, or that of the holy fathers and
          teachers of the Church. For if this examination and deepening of knowledge
          is right and proper, it will quite certainly enable us to understand clearly
          that we must with all our heart regard as valueless, vain and false, all
          that the blind and depraved world loves and seeks. In particular, we shall
          then see that the honours, pleasures and riches of this world are nothing
          but vanity and death to the soul; that the slander and abuse, with which
          the world persecutes us, bring us true glory, and its afflictions-joy; that
          to forgive our enemies and to do good to them is true magnanimity-one of
          the greatest traits of likeness to God; that a man who scorns the world
          shows greater strength and power than a man who rules over the whole world;
          that willing obedience is an action, which shows more courage and strength
          of spirit than subjugating great kings and ruling over them; that humble
          self-knowledge should be preferred to all other kinds of knowledge, however
          high; that to overcome and kill one』s own evil tendencies and lusts, however
          insignificant, is more worthy of praise than the capture of many fortresses,
          or the defeat of powerful and well-equipped armies; more even than the power
          to perform miracles and to raise the dead.
        cn: 陶冶心智的第二种方法，是时刻审察万物，深入探究其知识，以便清晰辨明其中何为善，何为恶。我们不应以世俗和感官的眼光来评判它们，而应以正当的理性与圣灵、或以神圣启示之经文、或以圣教父和教会导师之言语来衡量。因为，若此番审察与知识之深化是正确而恰当的，它必将使我们清楚地理解：我们必须全心全意地将那盲目而堕落之世俗所爱慕、所追逐的一切，视作毫无价值、虚妄不实之物。特别是，我们届时将看到：这世间的尊荣、享乐与财富，于灵魂而言，不过是虚空与死亡；而世俗加诸我们的诽谤与辱骂，却带给我们真正的荣耀；其苦难，则赋予我们喜乐；宽恕我们的仇敌并善待他们，乃是真正的伟大——这是与神相似的最伟大特质之一；藐视世界之人，所展现的力量和权柄，胜过统御整个世界之人；甘心顺服，其所彰显的勇气和心灵之力，远胜于征服列王并统治他们；谦卑的自知之明，应优于所有其他知识，无论其如何高深；克服并铲除自身之邪恶倾向与情欲，无论其多么微不足道，都比攻陷诸多堡垒，或击败强大且装备精良之军队，更值得赞扬；甚至比行神迹并使死人复活，更加值得赞扬。

        en: The reason why we have wrong judgment of the things we mentioned earlier
          is that we do not look deeply into them to see what they are, but conceive
          a liking for them or a dislike of them from the very first glance, judging
          by appearances. These likes and dislikes prejudice our mind and darken it;
          and so it cannot form a. right judgment of things as they really are. So,
          my brother, if you wish to be free of this prelest in your mind, keep strict
          attention over yourself; and when you see a thing with your eyes, or visualise
          it in your mind, keep a firm grip on your desires and do not allow yourself
          at the first glance either to conceive a liking for the thing or a dislike
          for it,, but examine it in a detached way with the mind alone. Unobscured
          by passion, the mind then remains in a state natural to it, which is free
          and pure, and has the possibility to know the truth and to penetrate into
          the depths of a thing, where evil is often concealed under a deceptively
          attractive exterior and where good is sometimes hidden under a bad appearance.
        cn: '我们对先前提及之事产生错误判断，其原因在于我们未能深入探究它们的本质，反而在第一眼便对其产生好恶，仅凭表象妄下断语。这些好恶之情，使得我们的心神充满偏见，使其蒙蔽，以至于无法对事物的真实面貌作出公正的判断。


          所以，我的弟兄，如果你希望你的心神能摆脱这般错觉（prelest），务必严加警醒。当你亲眼目睹一物，或在心中构想其形时，要牢牢克制你的欲望，切勿在初见之际便对其心生好恶。反之，当以纯粹的心智，超然物外地审视它。如此，心智方能不被情欲所遮蔽，保持其本然之态——自由而纯净，并得以洞悉真理，穿透事物之深层。因为邪恶常隐匿于诱人之外表下，而良善有时却掩藏于不佳之形貌中。'

        en: But if desire comes first and at once either likes a thing or turns away
          from it, your mind no longer has the possibility to know it rightly as it
          should. For if this predisposition, or rather this passion precedes every
          judgment, it enters within, becomes a wall between the mind and the thing
          and, obscuring the mind, makes it form its judgment from passion. In other
          words, it sees it not as it really is, which strengthens still more its
          original predisposition. The further this predisposition runs ahead, or
          the more it likes or dislikes a thing, the more it obscures the mind in
          relation to it, until it darkens the mind completely. Then passion in relation
          to this thing reaches its ultimate limits, so that it appears to a man either
          as the most desirable or the most hateful of all the things he ever liked
          or disliked. Thus it happens that when the rule I have indicated is not
          observed, that is, when desire is not restrained from forming likes and
          dislikes before a thing is properly examined, then both these powers of
          the soul-mind 「 and will-always work wrongly, plunging ever deeper and deeper
          from darkness to darkness, and from sin to sin.
        cn: 然而，若欲望先于一切而生，并瞬间或喜爱或厌恶某物，则你的心智便无从如其本然地正确认识它。因为若此种先入之见，或者说此种情欲，先于一切判断而存在，它便会进入内在，在心智与事物之间筑起一道高墙，遮蔽心智，使其判断源于情欲。换言之，心智所见并非事物之真实面貌，这反而会更进一步地强化其最初的先入之见。此种先入之见越是先行，或者心智对某物越是喜爱或厌恶，它便越发遮蔽心智与此物之间的关联，直至将其完全笼罩于黑暗之中。此时，心智对某物的情欲便达到了极致，以至于它在人眼中，要么是他所曾喜爱或厌恶的一切事物中最令人向往的，要么是最可憎的。因此，当我不曾指示的这条准则——即在事物未被妥善审视之前，不抑制欲望去形成好恶——未被遵从时，便会发生这样的情况：灵魂的这两种力量——心智与意志——总会错误地运作，从黑暗走向更深的黑暗，从罪恶走向更深的罪恶。

          will, so as not to let it lean towards your own desires, but instead to
          lead it to be perfectly as one with the will of God. Moreover keep it firmly
          planted in your mind, that it is not enough for you merely to desire and
          seek to please God. always and in everything; you must desire it as if moved
          by God Himself, and for one single aim-to please Him with a pure heart.
          To be firmly grounded in this aim, we have to endure a much greater struggle
          with our nature than in anything we have mentioned above. For our nature
          is so accustomed to please itself, that it seeks its own comfort and pleasure
          in all its doings, even the most righteous and spiritual, and secretly and
          lustfully feeds on it as though it were food. And so it happens that when
          we sec the chance of spiritual doing lying before us, we immediately desire
          it and impetuously rush towards it; yet not as men moved by the will of
          God, nor for the sole purpose of pleasing Him, but for the sake of the comfort
          and joy which is born in us, when we desire and seek that which God wants
          from us. This prelest is the better concealed and hidden, the higher and
          more spiritual is the nature of what we desire. This is why I say that we
          should not be satisfied with desiring what God wills, but must desire it
          how He wishes it, when He wishes it and for the reason and purpose He wishes
          it. The Apostle also teaches us to prove what is the will of God, that it
          is not only good, but also acceptable to Him and perfect in all respects.
          He says: 『Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing
          of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect,
          will of God』 (Rom. xii. 2). For if our action is faulty, even in one respect,
          or if we do something not with our whole will and strength, it is clear
          that it is, and is called, imperfect. This should lead you to the conclusion
          that even when we desire God Himself and seek Him, even this desire and
          search can contain some fault or omission, and may be mixed with some pandering
          to our self-love or vainglory; since we may have in view more our own good
          than the will of God, and do something rather for our own sake than for
          the sake of God. Yet He considers only those actions acceptable, which are
          done solely for His glory and wishes us to love Him alone, desire Him alone
          and work for Him alone.'
        cn: 除了训练心智去学习，你还应当管束你的意志，不让它倾向于你自身的欲望，而是引导它与上帝的旨意完美合一。此外，你务必牢记在心，仅仅是渴望并寻求永远在一切事上取悦上帝是不够的；你必须如同受上帝亲自感动一般去渴望它，并且只为一个纯粹的目标——以一颗纯洁的心去取悦祂。为了坚定地扎根于此目标，我们必须与我们的天性进行远比上述任何事都更艰巨的斗争。因为我们的天性如此习惯于取悦自身，以至于它在所有行为中，即使是最公义和最属灵的行为中，也寻求自己的舒适和愉悦，并暗中、贪婪地以此为食，仿佛那是美味的食物。因此，当我们看到属灵行动的机会摆在我们面前时，我们立刻渴望它并急切地冲向它；然而，我们并非受上帝旨意所感动的人，也并非仅仅为了取悦祂，而是为了当我们渴望并寻求上帝所要我们做的事时，内心所产生的舒适和喜悦。这种「神光错觉」（prelest）被掩盖和隐藏得越好，我们所渴望的事物的性质就越高、越属灵。这就是为什么我说，我们不应该满足于渴望上帝所愿之事，而必须以祂所愿的方式，在祂所愿之时，并出于祂所愿的原因和目的去渴望。使徒也教导我们验证何为上帝的旨意，它不仅是美好的，也是祂所接纳并完美无缺的。他说道：「不要效法这个世界，只要心意更新而变化，叫你们察验何为上帝的善良、纯全、可喜悦的旨意」（罗马书
          12:2）。因为如果我们的行动哪怕在一方面有缺陷，或者我们并非以全部的意志和力量去做某事，那么显然它是不完美的，也因此被称为不完美。这应该引导你得出结论：即使当我们渴望上帝本身并寻求祂时，这种渴望和寻求也可能包含一些缺陷或遗漏，并可能掺杂着一些对我们自爱或虚荣的迎合；因为我们可能更多地着眼于自己的益处而非上帝的旨意，并且更多地为自己而非为上帝的缘故去做事。然而，祂只认为那些纯粹为祂的荣耀而行的行动是可接纳的，并且祂希望我们只爱祂，只渴望祂，只为祂而工作。

          be clear whether it is the direct will of God that you should desire and
          perform such actions and whether they would be acceptable to God. And when

        cn: 当有合乎神旨意，或其本身是美善的工摆在你面前时，不要立刻倾向你的意愿，也不要不经事先将你的心意高举于神，就去渴求它。这样做是为了弄清楚，神是否直接希望你渴求并执行此类行动，以及它们是否蒙神悦纳。当你如此构思你的思想，使你的意愿的倾向由神的旨意本身决定时，那时你便去渴求并执行它。但这样做仅仅是因为神希望如此，仅仅是为了取悦祂，并且单单为祂的荣耀。

          either through divine enlightenment or mental illumination, in which God』s

          inspiration, by some inner word-or through some other actions of divine
          grace, acting in a pure heart, such as life-giving warmth, unspeakable joy,
          leaping of the spirit, being moved to tenderness, heartfelt tears, love
          for God and other blessed and God-loving feelings, produced not according
          to our will but coming from God, not by our own action but in our passivity.
          All such feelings serve as assurances that what we seek to do accords with
          God』s will. But before all things we must address to God the warmest and
          purest prayer, begging Him with all diligence, once, twice and many times,
          to illumine our darkness and to teach us. Pray three times, say the great
          fathers Barsanuphius and John, and then do as your heart inclines. Moreover
          you must not forget that all the decisions, formed in you as a result of

          我们对神驱动我们行动的真实感受，可能通过神圣的启迪或心智的光照而生，其中，神的旨意在纯净的心灵沉思中得以显明；亦可能通过内在的神圣默感，借由某个内在的言语；或者通过神圣恩典的其他作用，在纯洁的心中运作，例如赐予生命的热忱、难以言喻的喜悦、灵性的雀跃、被感动而产生的温柔、由衷的泪水、对神的爱以及其他蒙福而爱神的感受，这些感受并非依循我们的意愿而生，却是源自神，并非出于我们的主动，而是在我们的被动中显现。所有这些感受都可作为确证，表明我们所寻求之事与神的旨意相符。


          然而，在一切之先，我们必须向神献上最热切、最纯洁的祷告，以极大的恳切，一次、两次、多次地祈求祂，光照我们的黑暗并教导我们。伟大的教父巴撒努菲和约翰曾说，祷告三次，然后依从你内心所倾向的去做。此外，你切勿忘记，所有因我们所提及的内在灵性感动而在你心中形成的决断，都必须经过有经验者的建议和判断来验证。'

          to practise them solely to please God, and this not merely in the beginning,
          when we undertake them, but later too this right resolve should be renewed
          frequently to the very end. For if you fail to do this, you will be in danger

          Therefore St. Gregory of Sinai wrote: 『 Pay heed, also, to the intention

          whether it is for the sake of good itself and for the benefit of your soul

          of his own desires, and this to such an extent that the will of God becomes
          completely forgotten. Then he becomes so tightly bound by enjoyment of the
          work, that if God Himself were to hinder him in this practice, either through
          some illness, or through temptations from men or demons, or by some other
          means, he is filled with indignation, often blames one man or another for
          having interfered in the course of things he so loves, and sometimes even
          murmurs against God Himself. This is a sure sign that the disposition of
          his heart did not come from God, but has sprung from the rotten and corrupted
          root of self-love.
        cn: 所以，若人未善加自省，他或会仅为取悦我主而着手某事，但随后，渐次地，他会将私心杂念引入其中。这便使他从中也寻得自身欲念的满足，且程度之深，以至于上主之旨意全然被遗忘。于是他被这工作所带来的喜乐牢牢束缚，以至于即便上主亲自阻碍他此番行径，无论是以疾病，抑或以人与魔鬼的诱惑，或以其他方式，他便会充满愤慨，常常指责此人或彼人阻挠了他所钟爱之事物的进程，有时甚至向上主本身发出怨言。这确凿无疑地表明，他心之所向并非源自上主，而是从那腐朽败坏的自爱之根中滋生出来的。

        en: 'Know, that in this unseen warfare, two wills existing in us fight against
          one another: one belongs to the intelligent part of our soul and is therefore
          called the intelligent will, which is the higher; the other belongs to the
          sensory part and is therefore called the sensory will, which is the lower.
          The latter is more frequently called the dumb, carnal, passionate will.
          The higher will is always desiring nothing but good, the lower-nothing but
          evil. Each equally happens by itself, so that neither is a good desire in
          itself reckoned as good, nor an evil desire as evil. The reckoning depends
          upon the inclination of our own free will. Therefore, when our will inclines
          towards a good desire, it is reckoned in our favour; but when we incline
          towards an evil desire, it is reckoned against us. These desires follow
          one upon another: when a good desire comes, an evil desire immediately opposes
          it; and when an evil desire comes, a good desire at once rises against it..
          Our will is free to follow the one and the other, and whatever desire our
          will inclines towards, it becomes victorious on this particular occasion.
          It is in this that all our unseen spiritual warfare consists. Its aim should
          be never to let our free will incline towards the desire of the lower, carnal
          and passionate will, but always to follow only the intelligent, higher will.
          For it is the will of God, to follow which is the basic law of our being:
          『 Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man
          「 says the Preacher (Ecclesiastes xu. 13). Each of these desires draws our
          will towards itself and wishes to subjugate it. Stifle the lower desire
          and incline towards the higher-and victory is yours; but disregard the higher
          and choose the lower, and you will find yourself vanquished. St. Paul writes
          of this: 「I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
          with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I see
          another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing
          me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members』 (Rom. vu. 21–53).
          And he gives to all the rule: 『Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil
          the lust. of the flesh』 (Gal. v. 16). And this cannot be accomplished without
          struggling with the flesh.'
        cn: 须知，在这场无形的争战中，我们内里存在着两种意志彼此相争：一种属于我们灵魂的理性部分，故而称为理性意志，此乃高阶之意志；另一种属于感官部分，故而称为感官意志，此乃低阶之意志。后者更常被称为愚钝的、肉欲的、情欲的意志。高阶意志所求唯善，低阶意志所求唯恶。两者皆自然而然地发生，故此，善念本身不被算为善，恶念亦不被算为恶。其归算取决于我们自身自由意志的倾向。因此，当我们的意志倾向于善念时，便算在我们身上；但当我们倾向于恶念时，便算作与我们相背。这些念头此消彼长：善念一来，恶念随即对抗；恶念一来，善念立刻兴起反抗。我们的意志可自由选择追随其中之一，而我们的意志倾向于何种念头，何种念头便在彼时得胜。我们所有的无形属灵争战，皆在于此。其目的应当是永不让我们的自由意志倾向于低阶、肉欲、情欲意志的欲望，而要始终只追随理性的、高阶的意志。因为这是上帝的旨意，遵从祂乃是我们存在的基本法则，正如传道者所言：「敬畏上帝，谨守他的诫命；这是人所当尽的本分。」（传道书
          12:13）这些念头中的每一个都将我们的意志引向自身，并渴望将其征服。压制低阶的欲望，倾向于高阶的欲望——胜利便属于你；但若轻忽高阶而选择低阶，你便会发现自己被击败了。圣保罗对此写道：「我发现一个律，就是我愿意为善的时候，恶便与我同在。因为按着我里面的人，我是喜欢上帝的律法；但我看到我肢体中另有一个律，与我心思的律争战，把我掳去，服从那肢体中罪的律。」（罗马书
          7:21-23）他给所有人定下此规：「当顺着圣灵行事，便不放纵肉体的私欲。」（加拉太书 5:16）而这若不与肉体争战，便无法实现。

        cn: 那些在决定将他们属世和属肉体的生命转变为正直的生命，并全身心地投入到爱与真诚侍奉神的实践之前，曾因频繁满足他们肉体和情欲之意志的渴望而陷入邪恶习惯之人，最初必须经历极大的努力和艰辛的劳作。尽管他们明智的意志所提出的要求——他们渴望遵从这些要求——站在他们自由意志的一边，并由神使其活跃起来，然而在另一边，肉体和情欲之意志的渴望依然存在，他们对此仍怀有一种特定的同情。这些渴望与前者对立，以一头驮畜被缰绳拉扯的同等力量将其拽向自己的一边；唯有神的恩典赐予他们力量，使他们坚守所做的决定。长时间的抵制而不让情欲得胜，会削弱肉体欲望的力量；然而这并未结束这场斗争。

        en: So let no one dream of acquiring a true Christian disposition and Christian
          virtue, and of working for God as he should, if he does not want to compel
          himself to renounce and overcome all the passionate impulses of the will
          of the flesh, whether great or small, which he was formerly accustomed to
          satisfy, willingly and fondly. The chief reason why so few people attain
          to full Christian perfection is exactly their reluctance, through self-pity,
          to force themselves to deny themselves absolutely everything. But if, having
          overcome great passionate tendencies, they do not wish, thereafter, to compel
          themselves to overcome small ones, which seem unimportant, then, since these
          small tendencies are the outcome and expression of the great, by indulging
          in them they inevitably feed the latter, and so make them continue to live
          and act in the heart, in spite of the fact that they no longer manifest
          themselves on a large scale. And so the heart remains passionate and impure,
          and, above all, in no whit freed from self-indulgence and self-pity, which
          always make any practice to please God of doubtful value.
        cn: 所以，若有人梦想获得真实的基督徒性情与美德，并照着他应有的方式事奉上帝，但却不愿强迫自己弃绝并胜过从前习惯于乐意满足的一切肉体情欲的冲动，无论是或大或小，那么，他的梦想将终成泡影。极少数人能达至完全基督徒的圆满，其主要原因恰恰在于，他们因着自怜而不愿强迫自己全然弃绝一切。然而，即使他们已经胜过巨大的情欲倾向，但若不愿此后强迫自己去胜过那些看似微不足道的小倾向，那么，由于这些小倾向正是大倾向的产物与表现，他们沉溺其中，就必然会滋养后者，使其在心中继续存活和作祟，尽管它们不再大规模地显现。如此一来，人心依然充满情欲和不洁，更重要的是，丝毫未从自溺与自怜中解脱，而这两者总是使任何讨上帝喜悦的操练变得价值可疑。

          make a man guilty if, seeing how much they interfere with spiritual life,
          he does not trouble not only to destroy them completely, but even to try
          and keep them within harmless bounds, although this could be achieved with
          the help of God』s grace, due attention to oneself and zeal. Such defects

          and querulousness, obstinacy and argumentativeness, and so on. All these
          natural imperfections and faults should be corrected, in some by reducing
          excess, in others by adding what is lacking, and by translating both one

          imperfect, lame, mixed with the lusts, which reign in the world (John ii.
          16). And so such people make no progress on tile path to salvation, but
          turn round and round on one spot, and often even turn back and fall again
          into their former sins. This shows that even from the first their love for
          true life in Christ was not wholehearted, that they were not sufficiently
          filled with the feeling of gratitude to God, Who had delivered them from
          the power of the devil, and not perfect in their decision to work only for
          Him and to please Him. As a result such people remain forever untrained
          in good, are blind and fail to see the danger in which they stand, thinking
          that their position is secure and that no harm threatens them. Owing to
          all this, my beloved brother in Christ, I beseech you to love the hard toil
          and heavy burdens which inevitably accompany our unseen warfare, if you
          do not wish always to be overcome. The wise Sirach counsels the same: 』Hate
          not laborious work』 (Ecclesiasticus vii. 15). For this is the very foundation
          of the whole of inner warfare. The more you love this hard toil, or this
          pitiless driving of yourself, the more quick and complete will be your victory
          over yourself and over that in yourself, which resists the higher good.
          And through this you will be filled with every virtue and good disposition,
          and God』s peace will come to dwell in you.'
        cn: 于是便有此情况：有些人虽行善事，但这些善事却仍有瑕疵、瘸跛，混杂着世上所充斥的私欲（约翰二书 1:16）。因此，这类人在救赎的道路上寸步难行，只是在原地打转，甚至常常回头，再次堕入旧日的罪恶之中。这表明他们从一开始对基督里真实生命的爱就不是全心全意的，他们对上帝的感恩之情也未曾充盈，未能完全感激祂将他们从魔鬼的权势中拯救出来，在决定只为祂工作并取悦祂的意念上，也未臻完善。结果，这类人永远在善事上缺乏操练，他们是盲目的，未能看清自己所处的危险境地，反而认为自己的位置安稳，没有任何危险会降临。因着这一切，我亲爱的基督内弟兄，我恳求你，若你不愿总被战胜，便要爱那必然伴随着我们这场无形战争的艰辛劳苦和重担。智慧的息辣亦如此劝导：「勿憎劳苦之工」（德训篇
          7:15）。因为这正是整个内在战争的根基。你越是热爱这艰辛的劳苦，或这种对自己无情的鞭策，你战胜自己、战胜自己里面抗拒至善之物的胜利就越是迅速和完全。籍此，你将被一切美德和良善的性情所充满，上帝的平安将降临并常驻于你心。

        en: '(d) If these three inner actions are sincerely practised in your soul,
          they will never fail to give you victory over evil impulses. But this would
          mean only driving the enemies away. If you wish to strike at their very
          heart, then, if it is feasible, at once do something opposed to the suggestion
          of the passionate impulse and, if possible, resolve to do so always. This
          latter practice will finally free you completely from the renewal of the
          attacks you experience. I shall illustrate this by an example. Supposing
          someone has offended you in something whether great or small, and has aroused
          in you a movement of displeasure and irritation, accompanied by a suggestion
          of retaliation. Pay attention to yourself and hasten to realise that these
          movements are bent on enticing you towards evil. Therefore take up the attitude
          of a warrior on the defensive: (a) Stop these movements, do not let them
          penetrate any deeper and on no account allow your will to take their part
          as though they were right. This will mean resisting them. (b) But they still
          remain in sight, ready for a renewed attack. So rouse aversion against them,
          as against your enemies, and be angry with them for self-protection, until
          you are able to say sincerely: 『 I hate and abhor lying」 (Ps. cxix. 169),
          or: 『I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies」 (Ps. cxxxix.
          22). This will be a great blow for them, and they will retreat, but not
          vanish. Then: (c) Call to the Lord: 「Make haste, 0 God, to deliver me; make
          haste to help me, 0 Lord」 (Ps. lxx. 1). And do not cease calling thus, until
          not a trace of the hostile movements remains and peace is restored in your
          soul. (d) Having thus regained peace, do to your offender something which
          would show your kind and conciliatory disposition towards him, such as a
          friendly word, some timely favour, and so on. This would mean following
          the advice of David: 『Depart from evil, and do good」 (Ps. xxxiv. 14). Such
          .actions lead straight to acquiring the habit of the virtue opposed to the
          passionate movements which had troubled you; and this habit strikes them
          to the heart and kills them. Try to forestall, or accompany, or conclude
          these actions with an inner resolve, which would make such passionate impulses
          for ever impossible in the future. For instance, in the foregoing example,
          consider yourself worthy, of every insult and bring yourself to welcome
          every kind. of insult and calumny: welcome them and be ready to receive
          and accept them with joy as the most salutary remedies. In other cases,
          try to incite and establish in yourself other corresponding feelings and
          dispositions. This would mean driving the passion out of your heart and
          replacing it by the virtue opposed to it, which is the aim of the unseen
          warfare. I will give you a general indication, suitable for all occasions,
          in accordance with the guidance of the holy fathers. Our soul has three
          parts or powers-the thinking, the desiring and the excitable. Owing to their
          corruption, these three powers give birth to three corresponding kinds of
          wrong thoughts and movements. The thinking power gives birth to thoughts
          of ingratitude to God and complaints, forgetfulness of God, ignorance of
          divine things, ill-judgment and all kinds of blasphemous thoughts. The desiring
          power gives birth to pleasure-loving thoughts, thoughts of vainglory, love
          of money and all their numerous ramifications, belonging to the domain of
          self-indulgence. The excitable power gives birth to thoughts of anger, hatred,
          envy, revenge, gloating, ill-will, and generally to all evil thoughts. You
          should overcome all such thoughts and impulses by the methods indicated
          above, trying on every occasion to arouse and establish in your heart good
          feelings and dispositions opposed to them: in place of unbelief-undoubting
          faith in God; in place of complaints-a sincere gratitude to God for everything;
          in place of forgetfulness of God-a constant deep remembrance of the ever-present
          and all-powerful God; in place of ignorance-a clear contemplation or mental
          examination of all the soul-saving Christian truths; in place of ill-judgment-faculties
          trained to discriminate between good and evil; in place of all blasphemous
          thoughts-praise and glorification of God. In the same way, in place of love
          of pleasure -every kind of abstinence, fasting and self-mortification; in
          place of vainglory-humility and desire of obscurity; in place of love of
          money-contentment with little and love of poverty. Again, in place of anger-meekness;
          in place of hatred-love; in place of envy-rejoicing with others; in place
          of revenge-forgiveness and a peaceful disposition; in place of gloating-compassion;
          in place of ill-will-well-wishing. In short, with St. Maximus, I shall condense
          all this in the following propositions: adorn your thinking power with a
          constant attention to God in prayer and knowledge of divine truths; the
          desiring power-with total self-denial and renunciation of all self -indulgence;
          the excitable power-with love. If you do this, then, I assure you, the light
          of your mind will never be dimmed and wrong thoughts will never find place
          in you. If you arc active in setting up such good thoughts and dispositions
          in yourself morning, evening and at all other hours of the day, invisible
          foes will never come near you. For then you will be like a general, who
          constantly reviews his troops and disposes them in battle order; and enemies
          know that to attack such a general is impracticable.'
        cn: (d) 倘若这三种内在的行动真诚地在你的灵魂中实践，它们必能使你战胜邪恶的冲动。但这仅仅意味着将敌人驱逐。若你渴望直捣其心，那么，若可行，当即采取与激情冲动之建议相反的行动，并若可能，立志永远如此。这后一种实践最终会使你彻底摆脱反复的攻击。我将以一个例子来说明。假设有人在大事或小事上冒犯了你，在你心中激起了不悦与恼怒的情绪，并伴随着报复的念头。留意自己，并迅速认识到这些情绪正试图引诱你走向邪恶。因此，采取防御战士的姿态：(a)
          止住这些情绪，莫让它们深入渗透，绝不允许你的意志偏袒它们，仿佛它们是正当的。这意味着抵制它们。(b) 但它们仍然在视线之内，准备再次进攻。因此，激起对它们的厌恶，如同对待你的敌人一般，并为自卫而对它们生气，直到你能够真诚地说出：「我恨恶谎言」（诗篇
          119:169），或者：「我恨他们，深恶痛绝，以他们为我的仇敌」（诗篇 139:22）。这将是对它们的一次重击，它们会退却，但不会消失。然后：(c)
          呼求主：「神啊，求你快快搭救我！上主啊，求你速速帮助我！」（诗篇 70:1）。并且不要停止如此呼求，直到敌对情绪的丝毫痕迹都不复存在，和平重返你的灵魂。(d)
          如此恢复平静后，对冒犯你的人做一些能够展现你友善和解姿态的事情，例如一句友好的话语，一些及时的帮助等等。这意味着遵从大卫的忠告：「离恶行善」（诗篇
          34:14）。这样的行动直接导向养成与困扰你的激情冲动相对立的美德习惯；而这种习惯将它们击中心脏并将其彻底消灭。尝试预先、伴随或以一种内在的决心来完成这些行动，这将使未来永远不可能再出现此类激情冲动。例如，在前面的例子中，认为自己配得上任何侮辱，并使自己乐意接受各种侮辱和诽谤：欢迎它们，并准备欣然接受它们，视其为最能疗愈的良药。在其他情况下，尝试在自己心中激起并确立其他相应的感受和性情。这意味着将激情从你的心中驱逐出去，并以与它相对立的美德取而代之，这也是这场看不见的争战的目标。我将根据圣父们的教导，为你提供一个适用于所有情况的普遍指示。我们的灵魂有三个部分或能力——思考、欲望和易怒。由于它们的败坏，这三种能力产生了三种相应的错误思想和冲动。思考能力产生了对神的不感恩和抱怨、忘记神、对神圣事物无知、错误的判断以及各种亵渎的思想。欲望能力产生了爱享乐的思想、虚荣的思想、贪财以及所有它们无数的分支，属于放纵自我的领域。易怒能力产生了愤怒、仇恨、嫉妒、报复、幸灾乐祸、恶意以及所有邪恶的思想。你应该用上述方法克服所有这些思想和冲动，在每个场合都努力在心中激起并确立与它们相对立的良好感受和性情：以无疑的对神的信心取代不信；以对神的一切真诚感恩取代抱怨；以对无时无刻不在、全能之神的恒久深刻记忆取代忘记神；以对所有救赎灵魂的基督教真理的清晰默观或心智省察取代无知；以训练有素、能辨别善恶的能力取代错误的判断；以对神的赞美和荣耀取代所有亵渎的思想。同样地，以各种节制、禁食和克己取代爱享乐；以谦卑和渴望默默无闻取代虚荣；以知足常乐和爱贫穷取代贪财。再者，以温柔取代愤怒；以爱取代仇恨；以与他人同乐取代嫉妒；以宽恕与和平的心态取代报复；以怜悯取代幸灾乐祸；以善意取代恶意。简而言之，我将用圣马克西姆的话，把这一切总结为以下论点：以祷告中对神的恒久专注和对神圣真理的认识来装饰你的思考能力；以完全的自我否定和放弃一切自我放纵来装饰欲望能力；以爱来装饰易怒能力。若你如此行，那么，我向你保证，你心智的光芒永不黯淡，错误的思想也永不会在你心中找到立足之地。如果你在早晨、傍晚以及一天中的其他所有时间都积极地在自己心中建立这些美好的思想和性情，无形的敌人将永远无法靠近你。因为那时你将如同一个将军，不断检阅他的部队并将其部署成战斗队形；而敌人知道攻击这样的将军是不可行的。

          the passionate habit against which you tight. Since this habit has acquired
          power over your heart through frequent repetition of certain actions, which
          satisfy the passion dwelling in the heart, opposing it in the heart is not
          enough to weaken and destroy this power; you must use actions which are
          contrary to your former ones, actions opposed to the passion, smashing and
          destroying it. Their frequent use will banish the passionate habit, kill

          it is necessary to perform a greater number of right deeds, than the number
          of evil deeds required to establish bad habits; for bad habits take root
          more easily, since they are aided and abetted by the sin living in us, that
          is, by self-indulgence. Therefore, however hard, however difficult it may
          seem to you, to perform such actions, opposed to your passions, because
          your will for good is still weak, and because of the resistance of your
          passionate self-indulgent will, you must never abandon them, but must compel
          yourself in every way to practise them always. However imperfect they may
          be at first, they will still support your steadfastness and courage in battle,

          distract attention away from yourself and disorganise the good order you

          or not to desire it, if it does not wish. On the other hand, for this very

          In the days of old, when God led Israel into the promised land, He did not
          order them to destroy all the peoples dwelling there, but left five tribes
          alien and hostile to Israel- first, to prove the chosen people and to see
          how firmly they believed in Him and faithfully kept His commandments, and
          secondly, to teach His people the art of warfare (Judges u. 21–23; iii.

          just the same purpose, namely, to prove our love for Him and our obedience
          to His will, and to train us in spiritual warfare. The blessed Theodorite
          speaks of this in greater detail. God, he says, does this for the following
          ends: (a) to prevent us falling into carelessness and negligence and to
          make us watchful, diligent and attentive; (b) to remind us that the enemy

        cn: 默念上帝何以乐意将我们留于这争战之境，并非徒劳无益。其目的如下：古时，上帝领以色列人进入应许之地时，并未命他们尽灭当地所有部族，而是留下五个异族并与以色列为敌的部族——首先，是为了试验选民，看他们是否坚定信靠祂，忠实遵守祂的诫命；其次，是为了教导祂的子民战事之术（士师记
          2:21-23，3:1-2）。同理，祂也并非一举灭尽我们所有的情欲，而是将其留存于我们之内，任由它们与我们争战，直至我们离世。其目的亦然：即为验证我们对祂的爱与对祂旨意的顺服，并训练我们进行属灵的争战。蒙福的提奥多雷特对此有更详尽的阐述。他说，上帝如此行，乃为以下目的：(a)
          谨防我们陷于粗心与懈怠，使我们保持警醒、勤勉和专注；(b) 提醒我们仇敌时刻准备攻袭，以免我们猝不及防，被仇敌包围，为情欲所胜；(c) 使我们当常寻求上帝，祈求并仰望祂的帮助；(d)
          使我们不致骄傲，而能谦卑自省；(e) 使我们学习全心憎恨那些如此不倦攻击我们的情欲与仇敌；(f) 验证我们是否将上帝的尊荣、爱与信守持到底；(g)
          敦促我们更严谨地遵守上帝的诫命，不遗漏丝毫；(h) 使我们从经验中认识美德的巨大价值，从而永不肯「离弃它，陷入罪中；(i) 为使持续的争战赐予我们获得越来越大冠冕的可能；(j)
          为使我们因着忍耐「到底」而荣耀上帝，羞辱魔鬼；(k) 为使我们在一生中习惯争战，以便在临终之时，面对最艰难的攻袭，也不致恐惧。

          they have already found their way into us, we cannot afford to be negligent,

          to cease struggling against that passion and to submit to it, assuring You
          that this submission would be better and less troublesome, but You must

          not and be not afraid; let not this fear drive You to run from Your post

          surrounded by the commanders and centurions of His incorporeal armies and
          all the hosts of holy Angels, ready to fight with You against Your enemies
          and not let them overcome and conquer You, as is promised: 「 The Lord shall
          fight for You」 (Exodus xiv. 14).』 Therefore stand firm, compel Yourself
          not to give ground and strive by all possible means to stand up to the trial
          which has assailed You, calling from the bottom of Your heart: 『 Deliver
          me not over unto the will of mine enemies』 (Ps. xxvé. 12). Appeal to Your
          Lord, to the Holy Virgin, to all the Angels and saints. Help will come,

          men 『 (emboldened and intrepid warriors), 『because Ye have overcome the
          wicked one』 (I John é. 18). You may be weak and tied by bad habits, while

          for You from Him, Who has created and redeemed You/God Your Protector is
          incomparably /stronger than all others in this battle. As it is written:
          『The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle』 (Ps. xxiv. 8). Moreover
          His desire to save You is greater than that of Your enemy to destroy You.
          So fight and never weary of the labours of  this warfare. For victory is

          clashes, I advise you to do this: make it a rule every morning, while you
          still sit at home, to review in your mind all the occasions you may meet
          with in the course of the day, both favourable and unfavourable, and visualise
          the passionate impulses, lusts and irritations they may provoke; then prepare
          in yourself beforehand how to stifle them at the very inception, without
          allowing them to develop. If you do this, you will never be taken unawares
          by any movements of passions, but will always be ready to resist them, without
          being troubled with anger or enticed by lust. This review of what may happen
          should be practised especially when you have to go out and visit places
          where you are bound to meet people, who can either attract or irritate you.
          Being prepared, you will easily avoid the one and the other. If a wave of
          passion arises, it will roll over your head or will break against you as
          against a rock, instead of carrying you with it like a flimsy boat. Let
          the holy prophet David convince you of this as regards anger, when he says:
          『I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments」 (Ps. Cxix. 60).'

          passions is getting rid of the causes which are always giving birth to such
          movements. These causes are twofold; like and dislike. If you, my beloved,
          are caught and made captive by a liking for some person, or by attachment
          to some thing, whether great or small, it is natural that if you meet them
          and see them insulted or harmed, or someone wishes to entice them away or
          steal them from you, you immediately become indignant, grieve, become agitated
          and rise up in arms against those who do it. Therefore if you wish to be
          free of such sudden disturbances, take care to overcome and uproot from
          your heart this wrong attraction or wrong attachment. And the further it
          has gone, the more care you should use to have an equable mind and acquire
          a sensible attitude to things and people. For the stronger your attraction
          or passionate attachment, the more tempestuous the sudden uprising of passion
          in all the cases I have indicated.
        cn: 然而，面对突如其来的情欲涌动，最佳而最有效的防卫，莫过于根除那不断滋生此类波澜的根源。这些根源是双重的：爱憎二念。我亲爱的弟兄姊妹，若你被对某人的喜爱所俘，或被对某物——无论大小——的执着所缠绕，那么，当你遭遇它们被侮辱或伤害，抑或有人试图引诱或盗走它们时，你自然会立刻感到愤慨、悲伤、激动，并奋起反抗那些施予者。因此，若你渴望摆脱这猝然而至的烦扰，务必留心去克服并从心底拔除这份错误的吸引或执着。而且，这份吸引或执着越深，你就越当加倍谨慎，保持心境平和，培养对事物和人群的明智态度。因为你的吸引或激情执着越强，在上述所有情境中，情欲的突然涌动便会越发狂暴。

          them. Therefore if you wish to preserve the peace of your heart in such
          cases, urge yourself to stifle these bad feelings on this occasion, and
          later to annihilate them altogether.

          19:17）。你尤其要谨记：即便他们确然值得憎恶与敌视，倘若你仍能对他们生发友爱与慈心，你便因此而效法上帝，祂爱祂所有受造之物，不鄙弃其中任何一个，正如智者所罗门赞美主时所言：「你喜爱一切所有，不憎恶你所造的任何东西；因为你若憎恶，就必不造」（智慧篇
          11:24）。祂不顾世人的罪孽，「叫日头照好人，也照歹人；降雨给义人，也给不义的人」（马太福音 5:45）。

          『Most beautiful wounds, most holy wounds, immaculate wounds! Wound my wretched
          and impure heart and do not let me offend and shame Thee by my uncleanness.」
          During the time when shameful thoughts of bodily lust multiply in you, your

          nor the besmirching of your honour, and other similar things. Do not attempt,

          means of overcoming bodily temptations and may only give strength to the
          attacks and, at times, lead to your downfall. For, although your mind remonstrates
          with the lust and mentally upbraids it, yet the thought dwells on its objects,
          to which the heart feels such predilection. So it is not surprising that
          while the mind is lavishly pouring out severe condemnations of these things,
          the heart delights in them and consents to them-which means inner downfall.
          No, you must think of such subjects as would screen off these shameful things
          and completely distract your attention from them, things which, by their
          nature, would have a sobering effect on your heart. Such subjects are the
          life and passion of our Lord Jesus, Who took on flesh for our sakes, the

          undisturbed in your heart and thought, untroubled by any questions, but
          content with the ruling of your father. Only, you must reveal to him everything,
          which has troubled and is troubling your mind and feeling in this temptation,
          concealing nothing and not letting your tongue be tied by shame, but humbling
          yourself in self-abasement. For if, to gain victory, we need profound humility
          in all struggle with our enemies, how much more so at moments of warfare
          of the flesh? For in this case the very temptation is mostly either born
          of pride or is a reproof and punishment for it. Therefore St. John of the
          Ladder says that he who has fallen into fornication or some other sin of
          the flesh, had previously fallen into pride; and that his fall into sin
          was allowed, to humble him. 『 Where a downfall has happened, there pride
          has dwelt before it; for pride comes before a fall.』 And again, 『Punishment
          for the proud is to fall』 (Chapter 23). When shameful thoughts are at last
          subdued and temptation ceases, you must do the following: however much you
          are convinced that you are now free from attacks of the flesh, and however
          sure you are of yourself, take every care to keep your mind and attention
          away from things and people, who were the cause of this upsurging of temptation.
          Do not satisfy the impulse to see them, under the pretext that they are
          your relatives, or that they are devout and your benefactors. Admonish yourself
          with the thought that this too is a sinful blandishment of our corrupt nature
          and a net of our cunning enemy the devil, who assumes here the form of an
          Angel of light, in order to cast us into the darkness of which St. Paul
          speaks (II Cor. xi. 14).'

        cn: 那些热切追求公义的人，必须深刻思考并持续努力，严格管控并正确引导我们外在的五种感官——视觉、听觉、嗅觉、味觉和触觉。我们的心不断渴望并寻求安逸与享乐。它本应在内在事物的秩序中寻得这些，通过持守并承载那照其形象创造了人类的祂——那一切安慰的源泉。然而，在我们堕落之时，我们偏离了神，选择了自己，我们也因此失去了内在的立足点，堕入肉体之中；由此我们走出了自己，开始向外寻求喜乐与安慰。我们的感官成了这其中的向导与中介。灵魂通过它们走向外界，尝受每一种感官所体验的事物。然后，它便以那些令感官愉悦的事物为乐；并将所有这些共同构建成一个由安逸与享乐组成的循环，将其享受视为首要的善。于是，事物的秩序便颠倒了：心灵不再向内寻求神，而是向外寻求享乐，并以此为满足。

        en: 'Each sense has its own range of subjects, pleasant and unpleasant. The
          soul delights in pleasant things and, becoming accustomed to them, acquires
          a lust for them. In this way each sense introduces into the soul several
          lusts or tendencies and passionate attachments. They all hide in the soul
          and keep silent, when there are no causes to stimulate them. Sometimes they
          are stimulated by thoughts about the objects of these lusts, but the main
          and strongest cause of their excitement is when these objects are directly
          present and experienced by the senses. In this case, lust for them arises
          uncontrollably and in a man who has not yet resolved to resist it 『 bringeth
          forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death」 (James i.
          15). Then the words of the prophet are fulfilled in this man: 『 Death is
          come up into our windows』 (Jer. ix. 21), that is, into the senses which
          are the windows of the soul for communication with the outer world. In a
          man, who has let it enter, it rouses a struggle, not without danger of downfall.
          Therefore a man should make himself an immutable law to control and use
          his senses in such a way that no sensory lusts become excited, but only
          those impressions come in, which stifle them and excite opposite feelings.'
        cn: 每一种感官都有其自身的范围，包罗着愉悦与不悦之物。灵魂因愉悦之物而欣喜，并逐渐习以为常，继而生出欲念。循此之道，每一种感官都向灵魂引入了几许欲念，或曰倾向与激情之依恋。当无外因触动时，它们便潜藏于灵魂深处，寂然无声。有时，对这些欲念之对象的思虑会激起它们，但最主要、最强烈的刺激之源，莫过于这些对象直接呈现于感官并被体验之时。在此情境下，对它们的欲念便会不可遏制地涌现，对于一个尚未下定决心抵制之人，「私欲既怀，就生出罪来；罪既长成，就生出死来」（雅各书
          1:15）。那时，先知之言便在此人身上应验：「死亡从我们的窗户爬进来」（耶利米书 9:21），这窗户指的便是感官，它们是灵魂与外界沟通的门户。在已让死亡进入之人心中，它激起一场争斗，其中不乏坠落的危险。因此，人当为自己制定一条不可更改的律则：控制并运用其感官，使任何感官欲念皆不被激起，唯有那些能平息欲念、激起相反情感的印象方可进入。

          For, indeed, the whole world and all nature is nothing but a certain organ,
          in which, beneath what is seen, there is invisibly present the Architect
          and Artist Himself, the Maker of all things, either acting and manifesting
          His art visibly, or revealing His invisible and immaterial actions and perfections
          in the visible and the material, discernible to the sight of intelligent
          creatures. Therefore the wise Solomon says on the one hand: 『By the greatness
          and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen」 (Wisdom
          of Solomon xiii. 5) and on the other the blessed Paul testifies that: 『The
          invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen,
          being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and
          Godhead」 (Rom. i. 20). In the world of God all the creatures of God, wisely
          fashioned, are ranged on one side, while on the other are ranged men, endowed
          with the power of reason, to the end that with this power of reason they
          may contemplate the creatures and, seeing infinite wisdom in their creation
          and organisation, may rise to the knowledge and contemplation of the hypostatical
          Word, that is before time, the Word, by Whom 『all things were made」 (John
          i. 8). Thus from actions we naturally see Him Who acts; so we have but to
          judge rightly and soundly, and finding faith in what He has created we shall
          see in the creation its Creator, God.'
        cn: 我亲爱的，若您持守此项操练，那么通过您的五官，您将得以认识上帝，因您总是将心智从受造物提升至造物主。那时，一切受造物的本体与结构都将成为您的神学之书，而当您生活在这感官世界中时，您将分享那超乎世界之世界的知识。因为，确实，整个世界和所有自然界不过是某种器官，其中，在所见之物之下，那建筑师和艺术家自身、万物的创造者，无形地临在于此，或有形地行动并显明祂的艺术，或在有形和物质中，向有智慧的受造物之眼揭示祂无形和非物质的行动与完美。因此，智慧的所罗门一方面说：「由受造物之伟大与美丽，其创造者按比例可见」（所罗门智慧篇
          13:5），另一方面，蒙福的保罗见证道：「自从创世以来，神那看不见的事，就是祂永恒的大能和神性，都借着所造之物清楚地看见，为人所领悟」（罗马书
          1:20）。在上帝的世界中，上帝所有被巧妙塑造的受造物排列在一边，而另一边则排列着被赋予理性能力的人，目的在于，他们可以借着这种理性能力默观受造物，并在其创造与组织中看到无限的智慧，从而升华为认识和默观那先于时间、位格化的道，那借着「万物都是借着祂造的」（约翰福音
          1:8）的道。因此，我们自然地从行动中看到那行动者；所以，我们只需正确而健全地判断，并在祂所创造之物中找到信心，我们就会在创造中看到其创造者，即上帝。

        en: I have shown you above how from sensory things we can raise our mind to
          the contemplation of God. Now learn of another method of raising your mind
          from the sensory to the divine,-namely, through passing from the sensory
          to reflection on the incarnation of God the Word and on the holy mysteries
          of His life, passion and death. All the sensory objects of this world can
          serve as occasion for such reflection and contemplation, if, on looking
          at them, you traverse in your mind, as we described above, the thought that
          the Almighty God is the first cause of their existence and of everything
          in them-powers, perfections, functions, position among other creatures,
          and if you then think how great and measureless is the goodness of that
          same God when, being the sole cause of every created being, He desired to
          stoop to such humility and degradation as to become a man, to suffer and
          to die for men, allowing the very work of His own hands to rise in arms
          against Him and crucify Him.
        cn: 我已在上文向您展示，我们如何能从感官之物将心神提升至对上帝的默观。现在，请学习另一种将心神从感官提升至神圣的方法——即，通过从感官之物过渡到对上帝圣言降世以及祂生命、受难与死亡之神圣奥秘的沉思。此世间一切感官可见之物，皆可成为此类沉思与默观的契机，只要您在审视它们时，如我们上文所述，心中思量：全能的上帝乃是它们存在及其内在一切——能力、完美、功用、在其他受造物中的地位——的首因；继而您再思忖：当这位独一的受造万物之因的上帝，甘愿俯就如此谦卑与卑微，成为人类，为人类受苦并受死，甚至任由祂亲手所造之工反戈相向，将祂钉于十字架时，祂的良善是何等伟大且无可量度。

          flesh, that you might be clothed in His Divinity. Seeing yourself clothed,
          think of Christ our Lord, Who let Himself be stripped, to be scourged and
          crucified for your sake. If a voice should seem to you sweet and attractive,
          transfer this feeling of fond attraction to your Saviour, into Whose lips
          were poured all grace and sweetness, as is sung in the psalms: 『 Grace is
          poured into thy lips」 (Ps. xlv. 2); through the sweetness of His tongue,
          the people were ever following Him, reluctant to cease listening to Him,
          as St. Luke says: 「All the people were very attentive to hear him」 (Luke
          xix. 48). When you hear the murmur and shouts of a crowd, think of the lawless
          cry of the Jews: 『Away with him, away with him, crucify him」 (John xix.
          15), which then assailed the ears of the Lord. When you see a beautiful
          face, remember that He, Who was 『fairer than the children of man」 (Pa. xlv.
          2), our Lord Jesus Christ, was crucified out of love for you, 『despised
          and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief」 (Is. liii.
          3). Every time the clock strikes, let it bring to your mind the exceeding
          sorrow which filled the heart of our Lord Jesus, when in the garden of Gethsemane
          He was troubled at the approaching hour of His passion and death; or imagine
          that you hear the blows of hammers which resounded when our Lord was being
          nailed to the cross. In general, I would say that every time some sad occasion
          occurs in your life or another』s, bear in mind that every affliction, pain
          and sorrow of ours is nothing compared with the painful torment and wounds
          inflicted on the body and soul of our Lord during His passion suffered for
          our salvation'
        cn: 当你着装时，请谨记那不朽的圣言曾披上人的肉身，为的是让你能披戴祂的神性。当你看到自己身着衣裳，请思想我主基督，祂为你的缘故，甘愿被剥去衣衫，受鞭打，被钉上十字架。若有声音在你耳中听来甜美而迷人，请将这份喜爱的吸引之情转向你的救主，祂的口中倾注了诸般的恩典与甘甜，正如诗篇所唱：「恩宠倾于你的唇」（诗篇
          四十五:2）；因着祂言语的甘美，众人总是追随祂，不愿停止聆听祂的教诲，如圣路加所言：「众百姓都极其专心地听祂」（路加福音 十九:48）。当你听到人群的喧哗与叫喊时，请思想犹太人那不法的呼声：「除掉祂！除掉祂！把祂钉十字架！」（约翰福音
          十九:15），这声音曾冲击着主的耳畔。当你看到一张美丽的脸庞，请记住，那「比世人更美」（诗篇 四十五:2）的我们主耶稣基督，为着对你的爱，被钉上十字架，祂曾是「被藐视，被人厌弃；多受痛苦，常经忧患之人」（以赛亚书
          五十三:3）。每当钟声敲响，让它提醒你主耶稣心中所充满的无比忧伤，当祂在客西马尼园中，因受难与死亡的时刻临近而心绪不宁；或者想象你听到了锤子的敲击声，那是在我们的主被钉上十字架时所回荡的声音。总而言之，我想说，每当你的生命中或他人的生命中发生一些悲伤之事，请记住，我们的一切苦楚、疼痛与忧伤，与我们的主为我们的救赎所受的苦难中，在祂的肉身和灵魂上所遭受的痛苦折磨和创伤相比，都算不得什么。

          in relation to your senses and never allow the impressions you get through
          them to excite and feed your passions. On the contrary, use your senses
          in such a way as not to deviate even a hair』s breadth from your decision
          to please God always and in everything, or to be guided by His will. To
          achieve this, in addition to transferring your thoughts from the sensory
          to the spiritual, as we have indicated, it is very useful to practise the
          small rule mentioned in the first chapters-not to be spontaneously attracted
          by anything or spontaneously repelled by anything, but by strict and steadfast
          reasoning to determine, in each particular case, the attitude to be adopted
          to the impressions received through the senses, in order that it should
          conform to the will of God, which we know through His commandments.'
        cn: 简言之，我给你如下忠告：对于你的感官，务必保持警醒与专注，绝不可任由通过它们所得的印象激起并滋养你的情欲。恰恰相反，运用你的感官，使得你丝毫也不偏离你恒久且在万事万物中取悦上帝，或由祂的旨意引导的决心。为达此境，除了如我们所指，将你的思绪从感官层面转向属灵层面外，实践在前几章提及的小小准则亦极有助益——即不被任何事物自发地吸引，亦不被任何事物自发地排斥，而是通过严谨而坚定的理性，在每一个具体情境中，决定对通过感官所接收到的印象应采取何种态度，以使其符合我们通过祂的诫命所知的上帝的旨意。

          use of the senses to spiritual benefit, it does not mean that you should
          constantly practise them. No, what you must practise constantly is to collect
          your mind in the heart and remain there with the Lord, thus having Him as
          a Teacher and Helper in your victory over enemies and passions, either through
          direct inner resistance, or through the practice of virtues opposed to them.
          What I described was said only with the intention that you should know these
          methods and make use of them when necessary. All the same, it is unquestionably
          very useful, in our warfare, to cover all sensory things with a spiritual
          veil.
        cn: 我还要补充一点，如果我以上描述了将感官运用转向属灵益处的方法，这并不意味着你必须持续不断地练习它们。不，你必须持续不断地练习的是将你的心智聚集在心中，并与主一同安住于此，如此便能以祂为教师和帮助者，在战胜仇敌和情欲的争战中得胜，无论是通过直接的内在抵挡，还是通过实践与情欲相对的美德。我所描述的，只是为了让你知晓这些方法，并在必要时加以运用。即便如此，在我们的争战中，用属灵的面纱覆盖所有感官之事，无疑是极其有益的。

          and beardless. Neither let them look at naked bodies, not only those of
          others, but also your own. For such curiosity and lustful looking may easily
          give birth in the heart to passionate lust of adultery, which is not without
          guilt, as the Lord says: 『Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her
          hath committed adultery with her already in his heart』 (Matt. v. 28). And

          us against being enticed by the eyes and wounded by lust for beauty: 『Lust
          not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her
          eyelids』 (Prov. vi. 25). Here are examples of the evil results of licentious
          glances: sons of God, descendants of Seth and Enoch were attracted by the
          daughters of Cain (Gen. ch. vi): Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, saw
          Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and fell with her; Samson was captivated by
          the beauty of Delilah (Judges ch. xvi); David fell from looking at Bath-sheba
          (II Sam. ch. xi); two elders, judges of the people, were intoxicated by
          the beauty of Susanna (Dan. ch. xiii).'

          5:28）。有智者曾写道：「注视生欲望。」所罗门也告诫我们，切勿被眼目诱惑，被对美色的贪欲所伤：「你心里不要贪恋她的美色，也不要因她的眼皮被她勾引」（箴言
          6:25）。以下是纵情一瞥所带来恶果的例证：上帝的儿子，塞特和以诺的后裔，被该隐的女儿所吸引（创世记 第六章）；希未人哈抹的儿子示剑看见雅各的女儿底拿，便与她同寝；参孙被大利拉的美色所俘获（士师记

          conversation are more or less worthy of attention. But in most cases loquacity
          is a synonym of empty talk, and then there are no words to express the many
          evils, which arise from this ugly habit. In general, loquacity opens the
          doors of the soul, and the devout warmth of the heart at once escapes. Empty
          talk does the same, but even more so. Loquacity distracts one』s attention
          out of oneself, leaving the heart unprotected. Then the usual passionate
          interests and desires begin to steal into it, at .times with such success
          that at the end of such empty talk the heart has not only consented, but
          has decided to commit passionate deeds. Empty talk is the door to criticism
          and slander, the spreader of false rumours and , opinions, the sower of
          discord and strife. It stifles the taste for . mental work and practically
          always serves as a cover for the absence of sound knowledge. When wordy
          talk is over, and the fog of self-complacency lifts, it always leaves behind
          a sense of frustration and indolence. Is it not proof of the fact that,
          even involuntarily, the soul feels itself robbed』?
        cn: 美好的情感是沉静的。那些寻求言语表达的情感，大多是出于自我中心，因为它们寻求表达的，是那些能取悦我们的自爱，并能让我们——如我们所想——展现出最好一面的事物。多言多语大多源于某种虚荣，它使我们自以为洞察甚多，并认定自己对谈话主题的见解是所有之中最为圆满的。因此，我们便会体验到一种无法抗拒的冲动，想要倾泻而出，滔滔不绝，反复赘述，将同样的见解强加于他人心间，从而将自己强行作为不请自来的教师，有时甚至梦想着能把那些比教师更深谙此道的人收作学生。然而，这指的是谈话主题或多或少值得关注的情况。但在多数情况下，多言多语便是空谈的同义词，那时便无法用言语来表达这种丑陋习惯所带来的诸多弊端。总而言之，多言多语开启了灵魂之门，而心底虔敬的暖意便会立刻消散。空谈亦然，甚至更为甚之。多言多语将人的注意力从自身移开，使心灵毫无防护。于是，寻常的激情与欲望便开始潜入，有时甚至大获成功，以至于在一番空谈之后，心不仅默许了，而且已然决定去行放纵之事。空谈是批评与诽谤之门，是虚假谣言与见解的散布者，是纷争与冲突的播种者。它扼杀了对心智劳动的兴致，且几乎总是作为缺乏真知灼见的遮掩。当冗长的谈话结束，自满的迷雾消散之后，它总是留下一种挫败感和倦怠感。这难道不是一个证据，证明即使是不自觉地，灵魂也感到自己被劫掠了吗？

          perfect: 「If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and
          able also to bridle the whole body』 (James iii. 2). As soon as the tongue
          begins to speak for its own pleasure, it runs on in speech like an unbridled
          horse, and blurts out not only the good and seemly, but also the bad and
          harmful. This is why the Apostle calls it 『an unruly evil, full of deadly
          poison」 (James iii. 8). Long before him Solomon too said: 『In the multitude
          of words there wanteth not sin』 (Prov. x. 19). In general, let us say, like
          Ecclesiastes, that a loquacious man shows his folly, for as a rule only

          3:2）一旦舌头为求自身之乐而开始说话，它就会像脱缰之马般奔腾不已，不仅会脱口而出善美适宜之言，也会倾吐出恶劣有害之语。正因如此，使徒称其为「不止息的恶物，满了害死人的毒气。」（雅各书
          3:8）远在他之前，所罗门也曾言：「多言多语难免有过。」（箴言 10:19）总而言之，我们不妨像传道书所说，一个多言之人显露了他的愚昧，因为通常唯有「愚昧人...话多」。

          victory. Silence is much beloved of him, who docs not rely on himself but
          trusts in God alone. It is the guardian of holy prayer and a miraculous
          helper in the practice of virtues; it is also a sign of spiritual wisdom.
          .St. Isaac says: 『 Guarding your tongue not only makes your mind rise to
          God, but also gives great hidden power to perform visible actions, done
          by the body. If silence is practised with knowledge, it also brings enlightenment
          in hidden doing」 (ch. 31 in Russian edition). In another place he praises
          it thus: 『 If you pile up on one side of the scales all the works demanded
          by ascetic life, and on the other side-silence, you will find that the latter
          outweighs the former. Many good counsels have been given us, but if a man
          embraces silence, to follow them will become superfluous」 (ch. 41). In yet
          another place he calls silence 『the mystery of the life to come; whereas
          words are the instruments of this world」 (ch. 42). St. Barsanuphius places
          it above preaching the word of God, saying: 『•』If you are just on the very
          point of preaching, know that silence is more worthy of wonder and glory.」
          Thus, although one man 『holdeth his tongue because he hath not to answer」,
          another 『keepeth silence, knowing his time」 (Ecclesiaaticus xx. 6), yet
          another for some other reasons, 『for the sake of human glory, or out of
          zeal for this virtue of silence, or because he secretly communes with God
          in his heart and does not want the attention of his mind to be distracted
          from if (St. Isaac, ch. 76). It can be said in general that a man, who keepeth
          silence, is found wise and of good sense (Ecclesiasticus xx. 5).'

          20:6），然而亦有人因其他缘由，「为求世人之荣光，或出于对静默此美德之热忱，或因其心内与上帝暗中相通，不愿其心神之专注因此而分心」（圣以撒，第76章）。总而言之，守静默之人，必被视为有智慧且明达之人（德训篇

          the sensory objects we have seen, heard, smelt, tasted and touched. It can
          be said that imagination and memory are one general inner sense which visualises
          and remembers everything, that the five outer senses happened to experience
          before. In a certain way the outer senses and sensory objects resemble a

          all foolish imagination and outside all form, colour or sense-an immaterial,
          unsubstantial, formless and bodiless mind. But he gave rein to his imagination
          and filled his mind with images of being equal to God, and so fell down
          from this formless, imageless, passionless and simple immateriality of mind
          into a multiform, complex and coarse imagination (as many theologians believe),
          and thus from a formless, immaterial and passionless angel became a devil,
          in a certain way material, multiform and subject to passion. As he became,
          so also did his servants-all the demons. St. Gregory of Sinai writes thus
          about them: 『 At one time they too were minds, but having fallen away from
          immateriality and refinement, each one of them acquired a certain material
          coarseness, gaining flesh according to the level and nature of the deeds,
          whose practice qualified him. For since, just like man, they have lost the
          delights of angels (the angelic taste or the angelic heaven of delight)
          and have been deprived of divine bliss, so too, like ourselves, they began
          to find pleasure on earth, when they became material and acquired the habit
          of material passions 『 (ch. 123 Philokalia). For this reason the holy fathers
          call the devil a painter, a serpent with many forms, feeding on the dust
          of passions, a breeder of fantasies, and other such names. The word of God
          represents him as incarnated into a dragon, with a tail, ribs, neck, nose,
          eyes, jaws, lips, skin, flesh and other such members. Read of this in chapters
          xl and xli of the book of Job. Understand from this, beloved, that since
          multiform fantasy is an invention and creation of the devil, it is very
          welcome to him and useful in achieving our ruin. Holy fathers rightly call
          it a bridge, by which the murderous demons enter our soul, become mixed
          with it and make it a hive of drones, a dwelling place of horrible, evil

        en: (c) Know that according to St. Maximus, a great theologian, the first
          man, Adam, was also created by God without imagination. His mind, pure and
          free of images, functioned as mind and so itself acquired no form or image
          under the influence of the senses or from the images of sensory things.
          Making no use of this lower power of imagination, he did not visualise the
          outline, shape, dimensions, or colour of things, but with the higher power
          of the soul, that is thought, he contemplated purely, immaterially and spiritually
          only the pure ideas of things or their inner significance. But the devil,
          slayer of mankind, having himself fallen through his dreams of equality
          to God, instilled in Adam』s mind that he too was equal to God and these
          fantasies led to Adam』s fall. For this he was cast down from this immaterial,
          pure, intelligent and imageless life, akin to the angels, into this sensory
          complex, multiform life, immersed in images and fantasies-the state of animals
          devoid of reason. For to be immersed in images or to live in them and under
          their influence is the quality of reasonless animals, and not of beings
          possessing reason.
        cn: 敬请知晓，根据伟大的神学家圣马 Maximus 所言，第一人亚当亦是由上帝所造，而未曾有丝毫「想象」之能。他的心神纯净无染，超乎形象，仅以心神之本性运作。故此，在感官之影响下，或受感官事物之形象牵引，他的心神亦不曾获得任何形式或形象。他未曾运用这低阶的想象之力，因此未曾将事物的轮廓、形状、尺寸或色彩视觉化。反之，他以灵魂更高阶的力量，即「思想」，纯粹地、非物质地、属灵地默观事物的纯粹理念或其内在意义。然而，那残害人类的魔鬼，因自身妄图与上帝等同之幻梦而堕落，遂将亚当亦与上帝等同之念头植入其心，而这些幻想最终导致了亚当的堕落。因此，他从这种非物质的、纯净的、理性的、无形象的、近似天使的生命中被贬谪，堕入这感官的、复杂的、万象纷呈的生命，沉浸于形象与幻想之中——此乃缺乏理性的动物之境地。因为沉溺于形象，或活在形象之中并受其影响，是无理性动物的特质，而非拥有理性之存有的特质。

          imprisoning it in the narrow place of your heart and of the whole inner
          man, and teaching it constantly to stay there within, either in hidden prayer,
          calling inwardly: 『Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me!」 or
          keeping attention in yourself and examining yourself, but, above all, contemplating
          God and finding rest in Him. When a snake needs to cast off its old skin,
          it forces its way with difficulty through some narrow passage, as naturalists
          tell us; so too the mind, pushing its way through the narrow passage of
          the heart and of mental prayer of the heart, strips off the clothing of
          imagination of sensory things and of harmful sensory impressions and becomes
          pure, bright and apt for union with God, through its likeness to Him, which
          it thus acquires. Again: the narrower the defile through which water •flows,
          the harder it presses forward and the more swiftly it rises. In the same
          way, the more the mind is compressed by hidden training in the heart and
          by attention in itself, the finer and stronger it becomes and, rising on
          high, is thus more inaccessible to all passions, all suggestions of thoughts
          and all images of things, not only sensory but also mental, since all these
          things thus remain outside and cannot enter in. Here is another illustration,
          still more to the point. When sunrays are dispersed in the air, and unconnected
          with one another, they are Ices bright and warm than when they are concentrated
          on one point by means of certain lenses; then they produce a blinding light
          and a burning heat; so too when the mind is collected in the centre of the
          heart by attention to itself and hidden training, it becomes light-bearing
          and scorching; it disperses the darkness of matter and passion and burns
          up and destroys all material and passionate images and movements.'

          当蛇需要蜕去旧皮时，博物学家告诉我们，它会艰难地通过某个狭窄的通道；同样，心神，借着穿过心灵的狭窄通道和心灵的默祷，剥去感官事物和有害感官印象的想象之衣，变得纯净、明亮，并因其所获得的与上帝的肖似而适于与上帝结合。


          再者：水流过的小径越是狭窄，它就越是奋力向前，上升得也越是迅疾。同理，心神在心灵中被隐秘的操练和对自身的警醒所压缩得越紧密，它就变得越是精微和刚强，并由此高升，从而对一切激情、一切思想的暗示和一切事物的形象都更不可企及，不仅是感官的，也是心智的，因为所有这些事物都因此留在外面，无法进入。


          这里还有一个更为贴切的例子。当阳光分散在空气中，彼此不相连接时，它们的光亮和温暖远不及当它们借由某些透镜聚焦于一点时；那时它们会产生炫目的光和灼热的热量；同样，当心神借由对自身的警醒和隐秘的操练被收聚在心灵的中心时，它便会变得发光和炽热；它驱散物质和激情的黑暗，并烧毁和摧毁所有物质和激情的形象和活动。'

          and contemplations, both those suggested by the Holy Scriptures and those
          which God』s creation inspires. Such spiritual reflections are akin to the
          mind, since they are subtle and immaterial, and so do not coarsen it or
          imprison it in external things. On the contrary, satisfying within measure
          its thirst for unhampered movement in their domain, they dispose the mind
          by their tenor to return quickly into the heart and to unite with God through
          immersion in inner remembrance of Him alone. This is why St. Maximus says:
          『 Doing alone cannot make the mind passionless unless, in addition, it is
          devoted to various spiritual contemplations.』 Yet beware of dwelling only
          on the physical side of God』s creation, whether material objects or living
          beings, while you are still subject to passion. For, according to St. Maximus,
          in this case the mind is not yet free from looking with passion on sensory
          objects, and so, instead of passing from them to spiritual and immaterial
          thoughts concealed in them, it will be attracted solely by their external
          beauty and aspect and, in enjoying this, can derive false lessons from them

          out thence to fight us, is not my own thought. Listen to what the Lord says:
          『 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
          thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things which defile a
          man』 (Matt. xv. 19, 20). And the fact that our enemies, the demons, hide
          themselves near the heart is not my invention. Thus teach the holy fathers.
          St. Diadoch is the most definite among them, when he says that before holy
          baptism Divine grace moves a man towards good from without, while Satan
          is hidden in the depths of the heart and soul. But after a man has been
          baptised, the demon hovers outside the heart, while grace enters within
          (Philokalia 4. 76). However, as he says further (82), even after baptism
          our enemies are permitted to penetrate into the depths of our bodies and
          to reach as it were the surface of our heart, as a test to our will. From
          there they befoul the mind with the humours of carnal lusts. St. Gregory
          the Theologian teaches the same, explaining what the Lord said of the unclean
          spirit who goes out of a man, and then returns again, rendering that man』s
          last state worse than the first (Matt. xii. 43–45); St. Gregory points out
          that the same happens with baptised men if they take no care to remain in
          their heart. 『 The unclean spirit」, he says, 『 banished by baptism, and
          not caring to be homeless, seeks rest, walking here and there; finding no
          home, he returns to the house from whence he came out, for he is shameless.
          If he finds that Christ is held by the attention and the love of the baptised
          man, and is established and dwelling in the place from whence he had been
          cast out, that is in the heart, he fails to enter and again turns away.

          of attention towards God and memory of Him, he enters hastily, with greater
          malice than before. And the last state of that man is worse than the first」
          (40). I have purposely spoken at length about this to urge you the more
          strongly to remain ceaselessly in your heart with the memory of our Lord
          and Saviour and with prayer to Him, if you wish always to be victorious

          heart. When you are there with the Lord the enemy will not dare to come
          near.'
        cn: 那情欲与思虑潜藏于我等之心内，并从中而出攻讦我等，此非我一己之思。请听主之所言：「因为从心里发出恶念、凶杀、奸淫、苟合、偷盗、妄证、毁谤：这些都是污秽人的。」（马太福音
          15:19-20）而我等之仇敌，即众鬼魔，潜匿于心侧，此亦非我之杜撰。诸圣父皆如此教导。圣迪阿多赫于其中最为明确，他言，在圣洗礼之前，神圣之恩典由外在引人向善，而撒旦则潜藏于心与魂之深处。然人受洗之后，鬼魔便盘旋于心外，而恩典则进入其内（《爱圣集》4.
          76）。然而，正如他 आगे所言（82），即便在洗礼之后，我等之仇敌亦被允准渗透我等肉身之深处，仿佛触及我等之心表，以考验我等之意志。从那里，他们以肉欲之秽气玷污我等之心智。圣格列高利神学家亦教导相同之理，他阐释主所言之污秽之灵，此灵离开一人，然后再次返回，使那人最终之景况比先前更糟（马太福音
          12:43-45）；圣格列高利指出，若受洗之人不加留意，不住于其心内，亦会发生相同之事。「污秽之灵，」他言，「被洗礼驱逐，又不愿流离失所，便四处寻求安息；寻不到居所，便返回其所出之屋，因其无耻。若他发现基督因受洗之人之专注与爱而被持守，并已确立居所于其曾被逐出之处，即其心内，他便无法进入，再次离去。然若他发现其旧日之所空无一人，因对神之不专注及对神之记忆之缺失而无人占据，他便急忙进入，比先前更具恶意。而那人最终之景况比先前更糟。」（40）我特意详述此事，乃为更强烈地劝勉尔等，若尔等愿在思虑与情欲之扰动中常胜不败，此等扰动侵袭我等之心，则当尔等与我等主与救主之记忆并对其之祈祷，不息地居于尔等之心内。当尔等与主同在，仇敌便不敢近身。

          do not let your imagination and memory remember things previously seen,
          heard, smelt, tasted and touched, especially if there was something shameful
          and unseemly in them. It is this that pre-eminently constitutes our battle,
          and is more difficult and persistent than struggling with the senses or
          their use. Every one who fights knows this from experience. Not to accept
          some temptation through one sense or another is easily managed; but it is
          very difficult to control the imagination and memory of it, once it is accepted.
          For example, to see or not to see some face, or to look at it with passion
          or without passion, is not very diffi-cult and does not need much effort;
          but after you have seen it 『 and looked at it with passion, to banish from
          your memory the image of this face is already not easy, but demands much
          effort and no small inner struggle. And the enemy can play with your soul
          as with a ball, tossing your attention from one memory to another, stirring
          up desires and passions beneath them, and so keeping you always in a passionate
          state. Therefore I say to you: stay awake and, above all, watch imagination
          and memory.'
        cn: 但总而言之，我告诉你们，要警醒看顾自己，不要让你的想象和记忆回溯到先前所见、所闻、所嗅、所尝、所触之事，尤其是其中若有羞耻与不雅之处。这正是我们争战的首要所在，它比与感官或感官之运用搏斗更为艰难和持久。凡是争战之人，皆能从经验中得知此事。不透过此一感官或彼一感官接受某些试探，是容易办到的；但一旦接受之后，要控制其想象和记忆，却是非常困难的。例如，看见或不看见某张面孔，或带着情欲或不带情欲地注视它，并非非常困难，也不需太多努力；但当你已经看见它，并带着情欲注视过它之后，要从你的记忆中驱逐这张面孔的影像，就不再容易了，这需要巨大的努力和不小的内心挣扎。而仇敌可以把你的灵魂当作皮球一般玩弄，将你的注意力从一个记忆抛向另一个记忆，在它们之下搅动欲望与情欲，从而使你始终处于情欲的状态之中。因此我告诉你们：保持清醒，最重要的是，警惕你的想象和记忆。

          but just a little while. But as soon as you agree to this, he brings along
          another sin:-after a sin with the tongue-a sin with the eye, and again with

          second sin, since it is first necessary to purify yourself of the first.
          And in this way, putting it off continues for a whole day and sin after
          sin fills the soul. By evening-a time to which purification by repentance
          is usually relegated, nothing is clearly seen in the soul, for it is filled

        cn: 没有什么行动方式能比此法更有效地挫败那嗜杀的仇敌，并击败他的诡计。这正是为何仇敌会竭尽所能，从内而外地阻止此法：内在以思虑和情愫，外在则通过策划各种会面和事件。当您着手此项工作时，您自会明白这些障碍究竟为何。我仅提及一事：仇敌竭力唆使您，当罪恶被察觉时，不要立即开始内心的洁净工作，而应稍等片刻——不是一天，不是一小时，而仅仅是「一会儿」。但只要您同意了这一点，他便会带来另一个罪恶：舌头的罪后是眼睛的罪，接着又是其他感官的罪；于是您便不由自主地推迟了对第二个罪恶的洁净，因为首先必须洁净第一个罪。就这样，推迟之举持续了一整天，罪恶接踵而至，充斥着灵魂。到了夜晚——通常是悔罪洁净之时——灵魂中却一片混沌，因其已被众多被宽宥的过犯所带来的喧嚣、骚乱和黑暗所填满。此时，灵魂好似蒙尘的眼睛，又如被污泥搅浑的浊水。因一无所见，悔罪的工作便被完全放弃，灵魂也就此变得污浊不堪。这使得晚间祷告残缺不全，并导致恶梦缠身。因此，一旦您察觉自身有任何过失，切勿将内心的洁净拖延片刻。

          on distrust of ourselves and a firm trust in God. Therefore we are not devoid
          of high opinion of ourselves, the inevitable consequence of which is always
          withdrawal from us of the blessed Divine help and our consequent inevitable
          downfall. This is why a man, who decides in himself: 『 To-morrow I shall
          abandon the path of sin without fail 『, always meets with the opposite effect-
          that is, instead of rising up he falls down worse than before, which is
          followed by downfall after downfall. God sometimes allows this to happen
          deliberately, in order to bring the self-reliant to the realisation of his
          weakness and urge him to seek Divine help, renouncing and abandoning all
          trust in himself, since God』s help alone can be trusted. Do you want to
          know, 0 man, when your own decisions will be firm and reliable? When you
          abandon all trust in yourself and when all your hopes are based on humility
          and a steadfast trust in God alone.'
        cn: 首先，其中一个理由是：我们自身的决志并非建立在对自身的存疑和对上帝坚定的信靠之上。因此，我们并非没有自高的念头，而自高必然导致神圣恩助的离去，继而我们无可避免地跌倒。这正是为何一个人，若心想：「明日我必弃绝罪恶之道」，总会遭遇相反的结果——即，非但没有提升，反而跌落得比从前更糟，随之而来的便是一次又一次的沉沦。上帝有时特意允许此事发生，旨在使那些自恃之人认识到自己的软弱，并敦促他们寻求神圣的帮助，放弃并舍弃一切对自身的信赖，因为唯有上帝的帮助方可信赖。哦，世人哪，你可愿知晓，何时你的决断方能坚定可靠？那便是当你舍弃一切对自身的信赖，当你所有的希望都建立在谦卑和唯独对上帝的坚定信靠之上。
    - type: paragraph
      text:
        en: '(b) The second reason is that in making such resolutions we mostly have
          in view the beauty and radiance of virtue, which attract our will, however
          weak and impotent it may be; and so naturally the difficult side of virtue
          escapes our attention. To-day this side escapes notice, because the beauty
          of virtue strongly attracts our will; but to-morrow, when the usual works
          and cares present themselves, this attraction will not be so strong, although
          the intention is still remembered. When desire weakens, the will also becomes
          weaker or relapses into its natural impotence, and at the same time the
          difficult side of virtue stands out and strikes the eye; for the path of
          virtue is by its nature hard, and is hardest of all at the first step. Now
          let us suppose that the man, who decided yesterday to enter upon this path,
          today does so; he no longer feels any support for carrying out his decision.
          The desire has lost its intensity, the will has weakened, nothing but obstacles
          are in sight-in himself, in the habitual course of his life, in the usual
          relationships with others. And so he decides: 『I shall wait a while and
          gather my strength.」 Thus he goes on waiting from day to day, and it is
          no wonder if he waits all his life. And yet had he started work yesterday,
          when the inspiring desire to mend his ways came upon him, had he done one
          thing or another in obedience to this desire, had be introduced into his
          life something in this spirit- today his desire and will would not be so
          weak as to retreat in the face of obstacles. There must be obstacles, but
          if the man had something to lean on in himself, he would have overcome them,
          be it with difficulty. Had he been occupied all day with overcoming them,
          the next day he would have felt them far less; and on the third day still
          less. Thus going further and further he would have become established on
          the right path.'
        cn: (b) 第二个原因在于，当我们下定决心时，我们大多只看到美德的光辉与璀璨，它吸引着我们的意志，无论我们的意志多么软弱无力。因此，美德的艰难之处自然而然地被我们忽视了。今天，这一面被忽略了，因为美德的璀璨强烈地吸引着我们的意志；然而明天，当日常的工作和烦恼浮现时，这种吸引力就不会那么强烈了，尽管那份意愿仍被记着。当渴望减弱时，意志也变得更加软弱，或退回到它天生的无力之中，与此同时，美德的艰难之处便凸显出来，映入眼帘；因为美德之道，本质上是艰难的，而第一步更是最艰难的。现在，让我们设想，昨天决定踏上这条道路的人，今天这样做了；他不再感到有任何支持来执行他的决定。渴望失去了它的强度，意志变得软弱，所见的只剩下障碍——在他自己身上，在他习惯的生活轨迹中，在与他人的寻常关系中。于是他决定：「我再等一会儿，积聚力量。」就这样，他日复一日地等待着，如果他一生都在等待，这也不足为奇。然而，如果他昨天就开始行动，当那股激励他改过自新的渴望降临于他之时，如果他顺从这份渴望，做了一两件事，如果他将这种精神融入自己的生活之中——那么今天，他的渴望和意志就不会那么软弱，以至于在障碍面前退缩。障碍必然存在，但如果这个人内在有所依靠，他就会克服它们，即便困难重重。如果他一整天都在克服它们，那么第二天他会感到它们减轻了许多；第三天则更少。就这样，他越走越远，便会稳固地踏上正道。

          is not translated into practice, such awakenings do not easily come again;
          and even if they do come, their effect on the will is less strong than the
          first time. The will is no longer as quick in inclining towards following
          them and so, even if the resolve to do so is there, it is weak and lacks
          energy. Consequently, if a man was able to put off till to-morrow obedience
          to a stronger impulse and then lost it altogether, how much more easily
          will he do this a second time, and still more easily the third. And so it
          goes on: the more often obedience to good impulses is put off, the weaker
          their effect. After a time they lose their effect altogether, come and go
          without leaving a trace, and finally cease to come at all. The man surrenders
          himself to his downfall: his heart hardens and he begins to feel an aversion
          from good impulses. Thus delay becomes a straight road to final perdition.'
        cn: (c) 第三点，倘若从罪恶沉眠中苏醒的福祉未能付诸实践，这般觉醒便不易再次降临；即便它们再度来临，其对心志的影响亦将不如初次那般强烈。心志不再那般迅速地倾向于顺从它们，是以，即便有实践的决心，这决心亦是微弱无力，缺乏生机。结果，倘若一个人能将顺从一股更强烈的冲动推迟至明日，最终却全然失去它，那么第二次他会更轻易地如此行事，第三次则更甚。如此循环往复：顺从良善冲动的行为越是推迟，其效力便越是微弱。一段时间之后，它们便会完全失去效力，来去无痕，最终甚至不再降临。此人便将自己交付于沉沦：他的心渐渐刚硬，并开始对良善的冲动生出厌恶之情。是以，迟延便成了通往最终毁灭的坦途。
    - type: paragraph
      text:
        en: 'I shall add also that delays occur not only when an inner impulse is
          felt to exchange one』s bad life for a better, but also when a man already
          leads a good life. For instance, when an opportunity presents itself to
          do good and a man puts it off till to-morrow or till some other indefinite
          time. All that was said about the first form of delay applies to this second
          one, and it may lead to the same consequences. Know that if someone misses
          a chance to do good, he not only deprives himself of the fruit of the good
          he might have done, but also offends God. God sends him a man in need, and
          he says: 『Go away, later!』 Although he says this to a man, it is the same
          as saying it to God, Who has sent him. God will find him another benefactor;
          but the man who refused will have to answer.'
        cn: 我还将补充一点，延宕的发生，不仅是在内在冲动涌现，欲将恶劣的生活换为更佳之时，也发生在一个已然过着良善生活的人身上。例如，当一个行善的机会呈现时，而此人却将其推迟至明日，或推迟至某个不确定的未来。所有关于第一种延宕形式的论述，也同样适用于这第二种，并可能导致相同的后果。须知，若有人错失行善的良机，他不仅剥夺了自己本可获得的善行的果实，更是冒犯了上帝。上帝差遣一位有需要的人到他面前，而他却说：「走开，以后再说！」虽然他是对人这样说，但这与对差遣此人的上帝说出此话无异。上帝会为那需要者另寻一位施恩者；但那位拒绝的人，则必须承担责任。

          tactics, but not his evil desire and hope to make the man stumble against

          a man as being under fire from all sides:-from above and below, from left
          and right, from front and rear, from everywhere arrows speed towards him.
          Arrows from above are suggestions for excessive spiritual works, above his
          powers; arrows from below are suggestions to reduce or even completely abandon
          such works through self-pity, negligence and heedlessness; arrows from the
          right are when, in connection with some right undertakings and works, the
          enemies lead a man into temptation and the danger of downfall; arrows from
          the left are when the enemies present concrete temptations and draw a man
          towards sin; arrows from the front are when the enemies tempt and disturb
          a man by thoughts of what is to come; arrows from the rear are when they
          tempt him with memories of past deeds and events. And all these tempting
          thoughts attack the soul, either inwardly or outwardly: inwardly, through
          images and pictures of fantasy, mentally imprinted in the consciousness,
          or through direct evil suggestions planted in the heart, accompanied by
          habitual impulses of passion; outwardly-through the impressions received
          by the external senses in a ceaseless flow, as we have said already. Moreover
          our enemies have allies in our former sinful habits and our nature corrupted

        cn: 然而，假设一个人已经克服了最初的两个障碍，内心充满了渴望摆脱罪恶的束缚，并已毫不迟疑地为此付诸行动。即便如此，仇敌也并未放过他。他只是改变了策略，而非他那邪恶的欲望和希望，他仍旧期盼使这个人绊倒在某个诱惑之石上，从而将其毁灭。圣教父们描述这样的人，如同四面受敌：——从上而下，从下而上，从左至右，从右至左，从前至后，从后至前，箭矢从四面八方射向他。自上而来的箭矢，是建议他进行超越其能力范围的过度灵性操练；自下而来的箭矢，则是通过自怜、怠惰和疏忽，建议他减少甚至完全放弃这类操练；自右而来的箭矢，是仇敌借由一些正当的行动和善工，将人引入诱惑和堕落的危险；自左而来的箭矢，是仇敌呈现具体的诱惑，将人引向罪恶；自前而来的箭矢，是仇敌通过对未来事件的思虑来诱惑和搅扰一个人；自后而来的箭矢，则是他们以对过去行径和事件的记忆来诱惑他。所有这些诱惑性的思绪，或内在地，或外在地，攻击着灵魂：内在地，通过幻想的图像和画面，在意识中留下印记，或是通过直接植入心中的邪恶暗示，伴随着习以为常的激情冲动；外在地，则通过外部感官所接收到的印象，如我们先前所言，如潮水般不停歇。此外，我们的仇敌还有盟友，即我们过去的罪恶习性以及因人类堕落而败坏的本性。拥有如此众多的伤害手段，仇敌从不因初次的失败而气馁，他持续不断地运用各种方法，试图绊倒或误导那挣脱其权势的基督仆人。

        en: After a man has decided to abandon his wrong ways and actually does abandon
          them, the first task of the enemy is to clear a space for an unhampered
          field of action against him. He succeeds in this by suggesting to a man,
          who has entered the right path, that he should act on his own, and not go
          for advice and guidance to the teachers of righteous life, who are always
          attached to the Church. A man who follows their guidance and verifies all
          his actions, both inner and outer, by the good judgment of his teachers-priests
          in their parishes in the case of laymen, experienced startzi in monasteries-
          cannot be approached by the enemy. Whatever he may suggest, the experienced
          eye will at once see where he is driving and will warn his pupil. In this
          way all his wiles are defeated. But if a man turns away from his teachers,
          the enemy will at once confuse him and lead him astray. There are many possibilities,
          which do not look evil; and those he suggests. The inexperienced novice
          follows them and falls into an ambush, where he is exposed to great dangers
          or is destroyed altogether.
        cn: "当一个人决意舍弃邪径并实际离弃之后，仇敌的首要任务便是为自己清开一块空地，以便毫无阻碍地向他发动攻击。它之所以能成功，乃是借着向已踏上正道之人灌输，让他以为应当自行其是，而非向那些常与教会相连的义德生活导师寻求忠告与指引。\n\
          \ \n一个人若能遵从这些导师的指引，并以他们的明智判断来验证自己一切内外行为——对俗人而言，是其堂区的司祭导师；对修道士而言，是修院中富有经验的长老（starets）——那么，仇敌便无法靠近他。无论仇敌提出何种建议，那双经验丰富的眼睛会立刻洞悉其意图，并会警告他的学生。如此一来，仇敌的一切诡计都将落空。\n\
          \ \n然而，若一个人背离了他的导师，仇敌便会立刻使他困惑，并引他误入歧途。有许多看似无害的可能，仇敌便是利用这些来引诱。未经经验的初学者会追随它们，从而陷入埋伏，置身于巨大的危险之中，甚至完全被毁灭。"

          but also without help. A man who has decided to dispense with advice and
          guidance in his life, when left to himself soon comes to the idea that extraneous
          help is unnecessary in the conduct of his righteous life and actions. But
          the enemy hastens his coming to this idea by concealing himself and refrain
          ing from attacking the novice, who, feeling thus free and unhampered, begins
          to imagine that this good state is the fruit of his own efforts, and so
          rests on them, and, while reciting his prayers about help from above, mutters
          them through his teeth, merely as a meaningless formula. Help is not sought
          and does not come; so the novice is left to his own devices and powers.
          And such a man is an easy prey to the enemy.
        cn: 仇敌的第二种伎俩，是让初学者不仅没有指引，也没有帮助。一个人若决定在其生命中摒弃劝告与指引，当他独自一人时，便很快会生出一种念头，认为在行持其正直的生命与行为时，外来的帮助是多余的。但仇敌却加速他生出此念头，方法是隐藏自己，并克制不攻击这初学者。这初学者因此感到自由无碍，便开始想象这种美好的状态是他自己努力的成果，于是便倚仗这些努力。他口中诵念着关于来自上层帮助的祷文，却只是在齿间低语，仅是将其当作一个毫无意义的公式。帮助并未被寻求，也未曾降临；于是这初学者便被弃置于他自己的谋划与力量之中。而这样的人，便是仇敌轻易捕获的猎物。

          more and more, reach such a degree of self-reliance that they end by imagining
          that everything is possible for them. In this excited state they take disastrous
          steps: throw themselves into dry wells, jump down from the high rocks where

        en: 'Another result of self-delusion and of ascribing one』s successes to oneself
          is to assume the right to give oneself special dispensations and indulgences.
          There is a form of prelest which, when something new is introduced into
          life, as for instance in the case of a man who has repented, makes days
          seem like months, and weeks like years. Thus if a man has made a few efforts
          in the new order of life, the enemy easily hammers into his head the illusion:
          『 I have worked so hard, have fasted so long, spent so many nights without
          sleep and so on. It is time to have a rest.」 『Rest a while,』 suggests the
          enemy, 『give respite to the flesh; a little distraction is indicated.」 As
          soon as the inexperienced novice consents to this, indulgence follows indulgence,
          until the whole order of his righteous life is upset, and he drops back
          into the life he has abandoned and begins to live again in negligence and
          heedlessness, and never rolls up his sleeves.'
        cn: 将自身成功归功于己，并由此生出为自己开脱和放纵的权利，这是自欺的又一恶果。有一种形式的「神迷」（prelest），当生命中出现新的境况时，例如一人悔改之时，它会让日子如月般漫长，周日似年般久远。因此，若有人在新生活中稍作努力，仇敌便轻易地将这幻象敲入他的脑中：「我已辛劳如此，斋戒如此之久，度过了如此多不眠之夜，等等。是时候歇息了。」「稍作休憩吧，」仇敌怂恿道，「让肉身喘息片刻；一点点消遣是必需的。」一旦这缺乏经验的初学者应允了，放纵便接踵而至，直至他正直生活的整个秩序被颠覆，他跌回所弃绝的旧日生活，再次沉溺于疏忽与懈怠之中，永不卷袖奋起。

          these thieves are unsuccessful in this scheme too, then they steal noiselessly
          to the soul and flatter us by suggesting that we please God in everything
          we do. The first temptation is opposed by fervent zeal and memory of death;
          the second-by obedience and belittling oneself; the third-by always reproaching
          oneself. 「 It was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of
          God」』 (Ps. lxxiii. 16. 17). When Divine fire enters our sanctuary, evil
          habits no longer have power over us for 「our God is a consuming fire」』 (Heb.

          heart and does so, the enemy) knowing that he will thus become well grounded
          in the virtue of patience, attempts to disrupt this good disposition. For
          this purpose, he begins to remind him of the many good deeds he could have
          performed had his position been different, and tries to convince him that,
          had he been in good health, he would have achieved much in the service of
          God, bringing much profit to himself and others. He would have been able
          to go to church, to talk to people, to rend and to write for the instruction
          of his brethren, and so on. If he notices that such thoughts are accepted,
          the enemy introduces them into the man』s mind more and more often, multiplies
          and embellishes them, makes them enter the feelings and incites desires
          and impulses to such actions by depicting how successful these or other
          works would have been, and by evoking regret that the man is tied hand and
          foot by his illness. Little by little, after frequent repetition of such
          thoughts and inner movements in the soul, regret is gradually transformed
          into discontent and vexation. Thus the former good-hearted patience is upset
          and, instead of a medicine sent by God and a field for practising the virtue
          of patience, the illness presents itself as something hostile to the work
          of salvation. Thus the desire to be free of it becomes ungovernable, though
          still with a view to freedom to perform good deeds and to please God in
          every way. Having led a man thus far, the enemy robs his heart and mind
          of the good purpose, for which he desires to get well, and leaves only the
          desire of health for the sake of health, forcing him to look irritably at
          his illness, not as an obstacle to good but as an evil in itself. As a result
          impatience, not tempered by good thoughts, takes the upper hand and passes
          to complainings, thus depriving the sick man of the peace he enjoyed through
          good-hearted patience. But the enemy rejoices that he has managed to upset
          him. In exactly the same way, the enemy upsets a poor man who bears his
          lot with patience, depicting to him the good deeds he could do if he had
          a fortune.
        cn: 例如，一个病人若能甘心承受病痛，并付诸实行，仇敌（魔鬼）深知他将因此在忍耐的美德上根基稳固，便试图扰乱他的这份善心。为此，仇敌开始提醒他，如果境况不同，他本可以完成多少善行，并试图说服他，若身体康健，他本可以在侍奉上帝上大有作为，为自己和他人带来丰厚的益处。他本可以去教堂，与人交谈，阅读和写作以教导弟兄，等等。如果仇敌察觉这些念头被接受了，他便会愈发频繁地将它们灌输到病人的心中，使其倍增并加以美化，让它们渗入情感，并煽动对这类行为的欲望和冲动，描绘这些或那些善工本可以多么成功，并唤起病人对自己被病痛束缚手脚的遗憾。循序渐进地，在这些念头和内心波动反复出现之后，遗憾便逐渐转化为不满和烦恼。如此一来，先前那份甘心的忍耐便被打乱了；疾病，本是上帝所赐的良药和操练忍耐美德的园地，却呈现为与救赎之工为敌的事物。于是，脱离疾病的愿望变得难以抑制，尽管仍然是以自由行善和在各方面取悦上帝为目的。当仇敌将人引至此境，便会剥夺他心中和头脑中那份渴望痊愈的善意目的，只留下为健康而求健康的欲望，迫使他烦躁地看待自己的疾病，不将其视为行善的障碍，而是将其视为恶本身。结果，不被善念所节制的焦躁便占据了上风，转变为抱怨，从而剥夺了病人因甘心忍耐所享有的平安。而仇敌则因其成功扰乱了病人而欢喜。仇敌扰乱一个甘心承受贫困命运的穷人，其方式也完全相同，他向穷人描绘如果拥有财富他本可以完成的善行。

          the Ladder, you have already heard that when the enemy sees that all his
          attempts to lead you into evil have failed, he follows you stealthily and
          flatters you, suggesting that your life is wholly pleasing to God. This
          is his last temptation. Our response to his flattery is self-opinion, self-importance
          and self-complacency, which give birth to vanity and pride; vanity robs
          our doings of all value, even if they are good, and pride makes us abhorrent
          to God. So watch and repel all such flattery of the enemy, nor let it reach
          the heart, but repulse it from the first moment it touches the ears of your
          soul.

          thirst for heavenly life is a gift of God. These three constitute the spirit
          of our life, urging us heavenwards. You, my mind, are not mine: you were
          given me by God. Neither are the powers active within me-will, with its
          energy-mine. Nor does my feeling, the ability to enjoy life and all my surroundings
          belong to me. Ìy body, with all its functions and requirements, which determine
          our physical well-being, is not mine either. All this was given by God.
          And I myself belong not to me, but to God. When he gave me being, God invested
          me with a calculated complexity of vital energies and gave me consciousness
          and freedom. He ordained that I should rule over all existing in me, in
          accordance with the function and value of each part of my being. All this
          offers no grounds for self-praise, but only for realising the great and
          heavy duty imposed on us, and for fear of the answer we are to give to the
          question: What have we done with ourselves and of ourselves? Let us now
          turn to the means of life. There is in us the life of the body, the life
          of the soul and the life of the spirit. Each of them needs its own means
          of existence, they are all ready to hand, but they are all a gift of God,
          and not our own acquisition. Air, fire, water, the earth with all its treasures:
          the elements, stones, metals, plants and animals, which provide all we need
          as food, garments and houses, arc not made by us but are given. All the
          concepts we need about our surroundings, the forms of our daily life, of
          society and government, the arts and crafts and the rules of action in all
          these domains, we find ready-made and need only to assimilate them, instead
          of bothering our heads to invent them. Each man coming into the world inherits
          them from his ancestors. And where did our ancestors get it all? God sends
          down men endowed with special gifts and special strength of will, and they
          make new discoveries and improve human life. But if you were to ask any
          one of these inventors how he has arrived at one thing or another, he would
          answer: 『I do not know; it just came into my mind, developed, took shape
          and matured.』 So it has always been, and so it will always be to the end
          of the world: the means of livelihood for the soul are not ours-they are
          given. Even more is it so in our spiritual-moral-religious life. In the
          mind of our soul God has placed knowledge of Himself, and in our conscience-
          knowledge of His will, endowing each alike with the hope of eternal bliss.
          This is the seed of life of the spirit. It is sown in us and received by
          us at the moment when God breathes into us His divine spark of life. Each
          man, when born, brings this seed with him and in him; later the development
          of this seed is determined by the kind of people who surround him. What
          an indescribably great blessing it is to be born among people who lead a
          truly spiritual life! But look around you. We possess knowledge of the one
          true God, worshipped as the Trinity; we confess the Son of God, Who assumed
          flesh for our sake and provided all things for our salvation; and we believe
          in the Holy Spirit, whose grace animates us and who is active in building
          spiritual life in us; we are planted in the Church of God and receive in
          it all that is needful for preserving and raising up our spiritual life,
          and we are inspired by the expectation of the resurrection of the dead and
          of life in the world to come. All this we have in the most pure and unadulterated
          form, and none of it is our own-it is a gift of God. So you see how rich
          are the means which surround you for leading a life, which should be natural
          to you in all its fullness; not one of them is the fruit of your own efforts,
          all is given you. You are called to the banquet of life, already prepared.
          if you and I can boast of anything in this respect, it is perhaps only of
          how we have used it all. To possess all this in full force represents our
          wedding garment. Should we glory in it? Should we not rather be afraid,
          lest the bountiful Host of the banquet should come and say to us: 「 See
          what a banquet it is! But what of your garment.」'

          现在，让我们转向生命之道。我们里面有身体的生命，灵魂的生命，和灵性的生命。每一种生命都需要其特有的生存方式，所有这些都已触手可及，然而它们无一不是上帝的恩赐，而非我们自己的获取。空气、火焰、水、蕴藏万物的土地：元素、石块、金属、植物和动物，它们提供我们所需的一切食物、衣物和居所，并非我们所造，而是被赐予的。我们所需的一切关于周遭环境的概念，我们日常生活、社会和政府的模式，艺术和技艺，以及在所有这些领域中行为的准则，我们都发现它们已然具备，只需吸收，而无需费尽心思去发明。每一个降生于世的人都从其祖先那里继承了这些。而我们的祖先又从何处获得这一切呢？上帝派遣那些禀赋特殊恩赐和强大意志力的人，他们带来新的发现，并改善人类生活。但如果你问这些发明者中的任何一位，他们是如何取得这样或那样的成就的，他们会回答说：「我不知道；它就这样出现在我的脑海中，然后发展、成形并成熟了。」一直以来都是如此，直到世界末了也必如此：灵魂的生计之道并非我们所有——它们是被赐予的。


          在我们的灵性——道德——宗教生活中，更是如此。在我们的灵魂深处，上帝安置了对祂自身的认识，在我们的良知中，安置了对祂旨意的认识，并同样地赋予了每个人对永恒幸福的盼望。这是灵性生命的种子。它在我们被上帝注入祂神圣生命火花的那一刻，便播撒在我们心中并被我们接受。每个人出生时，都带着这颗种子，且在他们里面；随后，这颗种子的发展取决于围绕着他们的人群。生在那些过着真正灵性生活的人们中间，是何等不可言喻的巨大福祉啊！


          然而环顾四周。我们拥有对独一真神的认识，祂以三位一体受人敬拜；我们承认上帝之子，祂为我们取了肉身，并为我们的救赎预备了万事；我们相信圣灵，祂的恩典使我们活泼，并在我们里面建造灵性生命；我们被栽种在上帝的教会中，并在其中领受维护和提升我们灵性生命所需的一切，我们受着死人复活和来世生命的盼望所激励。所有这一切，我们都以最纯净无瑕的形式拥有，而这一切并非我们所有——它是上帝的恩赐。


          所以你看，环绕着你的生命之道何其丰盛，它应是你们全然丰盛的自然生命；其中没有一样是你们自己努力的成果，一切都已赐予你们。你们蒙召赴宴，这场宴席早已预备妥当。如果我和你在这方面有什么可夸耀的，或许只是我们如何使用了这一切。完全拥有这一切，便是我们的婚筵礼服。我们当为此荣耀吗？我们岂不更应该心生惧怕，恐怕那慷慨的宴席主人到来，对我们说：「看这是何等丰盛的宴席啊！可你的礼服呢？」'

          whereas now they are given free rein and so become manifest.'
        cn: 我再补充一点：我们所有在家庭中、在社会上、在工作中，可见地施行的行动，构成了我们的行为。若我们环顾四周，我们不得不说，整体而言，我们的行为是端正的。然而，我们不能断言，我们的内在状态亦同样端正。周围世人的目光对我们的意图施加着巨大的压力。这些见证者迫使我们不表露心中所生的恶念；我们克制邪恶，于是我们的行为显得端正。若没有他们，我们的行为将会截然不同；并且，只要我们确信没有其他目光能看见我们，我们的行为往往就会变成那般模样。有些人，一旦他们的外在条件改变，他们可以更自由地生活，所有先前因害怕被他人看见而隐藏的恶念便会爆发出来，一个曾行为端正之人会沦为酒徒、放荡者，甚至盗贼。所有这些邪恶的冲动并非在此时刻才诞生，它们早已存在，只是不被允许表达，而今它们被赋予了自由驰骋的机会，于是显露无遗。

        en: 'First of all I say to you: brother, in acquiring virtue do not follow
          the example of those who, in the course of the seven days of the week, arrange
          their spiritual works in such a way that one should serve one virtue, another-another
          virtue, and so on, without taking into consideration whether they stand
          in need of this or that at the actual moment. No, do not act thus, but take
          up arms pre-eminently against the passion which troubles you) most, which
          has often conquered you and which is ready to attack you again now. Fight
          it with your whole strength and strive to establish yourself in the virtue
          opposed to that passion, using for this purpose all suitable practices and
          tasks.; For as soon as you succeed in this, you will, by this very fact,
          bring to life all other virtues in yourself and will be clothed in them
          as in armour, which will then protect you from all the arrows of passions.
          『By nature our heart is full of good dispositions; but passions come and
          stifle them. These passions are not of equal strength in every man, but
          in one man one passion predominates, in another another passion rules over
          the rest. As soon as you banish the chief passion, all the others grow weaker
          and recede by themselves. When this comes to pass, the good dispositions,
          freed from their yoke, acquire 『 in you the strength natural to them and,
          standing at the door of, your heart, are always ready to serve you, whenever
          it is required. Secondly, do not allot any definite time for the acquisition
          of virtues, neither days, nor weeks, months nor years, saying to yourself:
          『I shall work, and then rest, and then, having rested, I will start the
          same work again.』 No, no rest is allowed here. Prepare yourself for continual
          labour, struggle and effort, allowing no thought of alleviation, in imitation
          of St. Paul, who says of himself: 『I therefore so run,-I follow after, if
          that I may apprehend, 『 -I press toward the mark』 (I Cor. ix. 26; Phil.
          iii. 12, 14).) To stop for rest on the path of virtue means not to gain
          new strength, but to dissipate the strength one has acquired and to become
          weakened; and this is the same as turning back, or as destroying what was
          so laboriously built. By stopping I mean-imagining that the virtue is already
          gained in its perfection, and so paying no attention to its deficiencies
          and neglecting chances of good actions. Be not like that, but be always
          watchful and zealous. Do not shut your eyes, do not turn away when you meet
          with such chances, but, on the contrary, look out for them and strive towards
          them. Look upon them with love-all, but especially those, which present
          some difficulties to achieving what is right in them. The straining of our
          powers to overcome obstacles in right actions brings the habit of virtue
          more quickly and sends its roots deeper into the heart. Only avoid, all
          you can, those occasions which, while they offer a chance to manifest the
          virtue of chastity, at the same time threaten to set unclean lust on fire
          in you. It is better not to let this fire come near your members, lest you
          be scorched and burnt by it.'

          其次，不要为获取美德设定任何明确的时间，无论是日子、周、月或年，不要对自己说：「我将努力工作，然后休息，休息过后，我将重新开始同样的工作。」不，这里不允许休息。要为持续的劳作、争战和努力做好准备，不容许任何减轻的念头，效仿圣保罗，他论及自己说：「我奔跑，我追赶，或者我可以得着，我向着标杆直跑。」（哥林多前书
          9:26，腓立比书 3:12，14）在美德的道路上停下来休息，并非为了获得新的力量，而是会消散已获得的力量，并使人衰弱；这等同于倒退，或者摧毁那辛劳建造的一切。我所说的「停下来」，是指——以为美德已然完美获得，因此不注意其不足之处，并忽略行善的机会。不要如此，而要时刻警醒并热切。当遇到这样的机会时，不要闭上眼睛，不要转过身去，相反地，要寻找它们并努力争取它们。要用爱来审视它们——所有机会，尤其是那些在其中实现正确之事会带来某些困难的机会。我们竭力克服正确行动中的障碍，能更快地带来美德的习惯，并使其根系更深地扎入心中。然而，要尽可能避免那些在提供展现贞洁美德机会的同时，又可能在你心中点燃不洁欲望的场合。最好不要让这火接近你的肢体，以免你被它灼伤烧毁。'

        en: 'Fifthly: be an implacable enemy of all earthly comforts and sensory pleasures,
          which are born of self-indulgence and feed it. Through this you will be
          less often subject to attack not only by carnal, but generally by all passions,
          for they are all rooted in self-indulgence. When self-indulgence is subdued
          and cut off, they lose their power, stability and firmness, since they have
          no foothold. Do not give way to the thought: 『I will indulge in one pleasure,
          taste one enjoyment.」 Even if it is not sinful in itself, the fact remains
          that it was admitted only through pandering to oneself; and during this
          moment of self-indulgence all passions will raise their heads and begin
          to wriggle like squashed worms when water is poured on them. And it is not
          surprising if one of them flares up with such force that struggle with it
          is hard and victory doubtful. So never forget the following words of the
          Scriptures:: 「Íe that loveth his life (that is, the self-indulgent man)
          shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world (a man who does
          not give way to self-indulgence) shall keep it unto life eternal』 (John
          xii. 25). 『Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
          after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
          through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live』 (Rom.
          Viii. 12–13).'
        cn: 第五，对一切世俗的安逸与感官的欢愉，要成为一个毫不妥协的敌人。这些欢愉皆源于自我放纵，也滋养着自我放纵。借此，你将不那么频繁地受到攻击，不仅是肉体上的情欲，更是一切情欲的攻击，因为它们都根植于自我放纵。当自我放纵被制服并斩断，它们便会失去力量、稳定与坚固，因为它们已无立足之地。不要向这样的念头让步：「我将沉溺于一种愉悦，品尝一种享受。」即使它本身并非罪恶，事实依然是，它仅仅是因自我放纵而被允许的；而在这自我放纵的片刻，所有情欲都会昂首，开始蠕动，如同被压扁的虫子被泼上水一般。倘若其中之一以如此巨大的力量炽烈燃起，以至于与之搏斗变得艰难，胜利亦不可知，这便不足为奇了。所以，永远不要忘记圣经中的以下话语：「爱惜自己生命的（即放纵自我的人），必丧掉生命；恨恶自己今生生命的（一个不向自我放纵让步的人），要保全生命到永生」（约翰福音
          12:25）。「弟兄们，这样看来，我们并不是欠肉体的债，去顺从肉体活着。因为你们若顺从肉体活着，必要死；若靠着圣灵治死身体的恶行，必要活着」（罗马书

          the fullness of perfection, must set no limits to his efforts to gain success
          in all things. Yet he must moderate and direct excessive transports of his
          spiritual zeal by good judgment. Ðarticularly in the beginning, such transports
          surge up suddenly with great vigour and carry us away with irresistible
          force; but later they gradually grow weaker and weaker, until they die down
          altogether, leaving us stranded in the middle of our journey. For not only
          should external, bodily virtues be acquired little by little, by gradually
          ascending, as by the rungs of a ladder, but in the acquisition of the inner
          virtues of the soul one should also observe a definite order and sequence,
          since only then does our little become much and remain with us for ever.
          For example, in the process of acquiring the inner virtue of patience, it
          is impossible at once to welcome injustice, injuries and all other forms
          of un-pleasantness, to seek them and rejoice in them, although, it is possible
          to endure them with patience when they come. For welcoming them and rejoicing
          in them are the highest degrees of patience, and before you reach them you
          should traverse the lower degrees, which are: humble self-depreciation,
          in which you consider yourself worthy of every insult, overcoming in yourself
          impulses of revenge, hatred of the least thought of revenge, and so on.'

          soul with greater ease and firmness. For when you are constantly exercising
          yourself in one virtue above all others, your memory will be almost entirely
          occupied by this alone, and your mind, thus welded to the thought of it,
          will acquire more quickly the skill of finding means and occasions for its
          practice, while your will will cleave to it with greater readiness and desire.

          virtue. For one virtue usually stimulates another, akin to it, and helps

          and they evoke disorderly inner movements and tendencies, especially where
          our external surroundings favour it. These inner movements always disorganise

          path. Moreover a certain secret sweetness, sent by God, flows into our heart
          and increases from hour to hour. Through this, as we press forward with

          begins to practise every kind of good, no longer urged with effort, lacking
          all taste for it, but with ready inclination and joy. For, having subdued
          and conquered passions and renounced all that belongs to the creature, it

        en: I should explain here that, in advising you to use the most important
          occasions to gain virtue, I do not mean to advise you to disregard the less
          important chances, or to miss them through neglecting them. No, you should
          never miss any of them, whether important or unimportant, in order to be
          working always for virtue. For instance, you should bear patiently not only
          blatant abuse and reviling, or, if so happens, blows, but even a scowling
          look and a scornful expression, or a sharp word. Since such unimportant
          cases are more frequent, our right reactions have more chances of showing
          themselves and so keep our moral strength in a constant state of tension,
          thus giving us enough force to behave as we should also on important occasions.
          If we disregard these opportunities, we weaken our moral strength and render
          it less capable of dealing with important occasions.
        cn: 我在此阐明，我建议你把握重要的时机以获取美德，并非是让你忽视那些不那么重要的机会，或因疏忽而错失它们。不，你绝不应该错过任何一个机会，无论其重要与否，以便你时刻都在为美德而努力。例如，你不仅要耐心承受公然的辱骂与诽谤，或者，如果发生的话，承受殴打，甚至是一个怒视、一个轻蔑的表情，或一句尖锐的言语，你也当耐心承受。由于这类不重要的情形更为频繁，我们正确的反应便有更多的机会展现出来，从而使我们的道德力量持续处于一种紧绷状态，由此赋予我们足够的力量，以便在重要场合也能表现得体。倘若我们忽视这些机会，我们便会削弱我们的道德力量，使其在应对重要场合时变得能力不足。

          we may gain thereby a certain spiritual fruit. Although we cannot suppose
          that some things, such as our sins and those of other people, are a direct
          result of a willed action of God』s, yet even they do not happen without
          God』s leave, as means of admonishing and humbling us. As regards sufferings

        en: 'Thus, convinced that God Himself wishes you to endure the hardship and
          grief, which assails you, either arising from the evil nature of other people,
          or invited by your own wrong actions, you will cease to think and say as
          some others do: no, this does not come from God, it is unjust and criminal,
          and God does not want crime and turns away with loathing from it and from
          those who commit it. By this they want to justify their lack of patience
          and the gusts of anger and feelings of revenge they feel at the sight of
          injustice; but in actual fact the only thing they achieve is to rebel against
          God』s ordinance and to attempt to cast off the life-saving cross, imposed
          on them by God for their own good, instead of shouldering it with a good
          heart, which would undoubtedly be pleasing to Him. And what do they get?
          They cannot cast off their cross, they offend God, and still they gain no
          peace. On the contrary, to grief they add contention and useless irritation
          and render their state unbearable; whereas had they borne what happened
          with a good heart, they would have been at peace and would have attracted
          God』s benevolence, and would have eaten richly of the fruit of the spirit.
          So make it a rule for yourself:- when you meet with injustices, injuries
          and attacks, pay no attention to them, however wrong your offenders may
          be, but keep your attention firmly on one thing alone-that God let this
          happen for your good and that you will deprive yourself of this good if
          you admit impatience, irritation or contention in connection with it. And
          do not try to analyse the exact reason why God has allowed this. Do you
          believe that God is always right and merciful? Then believe that on this
          occasion too He shows you justice and mercy, although you do not see how.
          And remember how the Lord blesses those who behave thus: 『Blessed are they
          that have not seen, and yet have believed」 (John xx. 29).'
        cn: 因此，当你确信神自己乐意让你忍受那些临到你的艰难与悲伤——无论是源自他人的邪恶本性，还是因你自己的过失所招致——你便会停止像某些人那样思考和言说：不，这并非来自神，这是不公且罪恶的，神不愿罪恶，并憎恶罪恶及其施行者。他们借此想要为自己的不耐与在目睹不公时所感到的怒火和报复心辩解；但实际上，他们所成就的，不过是反抗神的旨意，并试图抛弃那为他们益处由神所加予的救赎之十字架，而非以善心背负它，而这无疑是蒙神喜悦的。他们又得到了什么呢？他们无法摆脱自己的十字架，反而冒犯了神，却仍未得平安。恰恰相反，他们是在悲伤之上又增添了争执和无益的烦恼，使自己的境况变得难以承受；然而，若他们能以善心承受所发生的一切，他们便会享有平安，并会吸引神的恩慈，丰盛地享用圣灵的果实。所以，为你自己立下规矩：当你遭遇不公、伤害和攻击时，不要理会它们，无论你的冒犯者多么错误，但要坚定地只专注于一件事——神允许此事发生是为了你的益处，而若你因此而心生不耐、烦恼或争执，你便会失去这份益处。并且，不要试图分析神为何允许此事发生的具体原因。你是否相信神永远是公义和慈悲的？那么，也要相信在此事上祂也向你显明公义和慈悲，尽管你看不清其方式。并要记住主是如何祝福那些如此行事的人：「没有看见就信的，有福了。」（约翰福音
          20:29）

          on the right road or has deviated from it and is following some side track,
          and keep these signs constantly in mind. He considers these signs and tokens
          to be the following: 『If you see that your mind is not being forced, but
          acts freely and presses forward in good thoughts, this is a sign of progress;
          in the same way when, standing in prayer, your mind does not wander hither
          and thither, and your tongue suddenly stops in the middle of a verse, and
          the shackles of silence are laid on your soul, without participation of
          your will; also, when you notice that with each good thought and memory
          arising in your soul, and with every spiritual contemplation your eyes are
          filled with tears, and they run freely down your cheeks, or when sometimes

          and impulses have not been experienced for a long time. For this may conceal
          the evil wiles of the man-hater-the devil-and the craftiness of the sin
          which lives in us; for these things, which are of a quite different nature,
          are often seen by us in a good light and we accept them as good through
          the pride concealed in us. Moreover, if we think of the perfection to which
          God calls us, then, even if we have followed for a long time the path of
          virtue, we shall be the more ready to think that we have hardly made a start
          in the life we ought to lead, let alone being established in it. This is
          why the holy fathers call even the life of the most perfect men imperfect,-that
          is, not free from faults. 『Even the perfection of the perfect is not perfect』,
          says St. John of the Ladder. And St. Paul sees perfection in constantly
          pressing on and on, with no looking back or thinking that we have already
          attained what we seek. Thus he calls himself imperfect, not having yet attained
          what he seeks. 『Not as though I had already attained」 he says, 『either were
          already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend . . . Brethren,
          I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting
          those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which
          are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
          God in Christ Jesus 「 (Phil. iii. 12–14). And wishing to show that this
          alone constitutes our perfection, he adds: 『Let us therefore, as many as
          be perfect, be thus minded」 (Phil. iii. 15). In other words: perfection
          is not to think that we have reached perfection; the virtuous state is not
          to stand still but constantly to press forward towards virtue.'
        cn: 然而，我们若过度确信自己已完全安立于所渴慕的美德，或已最终战胜某种情欲，即便长久以来未曾感受其冲击与冲动，这仍是错谬的。因这或能隐蔽那仇恨人类者——魔鬼——的邪恶意图，以及深藏于我辈之内的罪恶狡计；此二者性质迥异，却常被我辈误以为善，并因内隐的骄傲而欣然接受。再者，若我们思及上帝所召唤我辈臻至的圆满境界，即便已长久行走于美德之路，我们亦将更乐于认为自己在当度之生活中几乎未曾启程，更遑论已安立其中。此乃圣教父们称最完美之人的生命亦为不完美（即不免于过失）的原因。如圣阶梯约翰所言：「即便完美者的圆满亦非完美。」而圣保罗则视圆满为不断前行，永不回顾，亦不以为已然获得所求。故他自称不完美，尚未获得所求。「这并不是说我已经得着了，或已经完全了；我乃是竭力追求，或者可以得着……弟兄们，我不是以为自己已经得着了；我只有一件事，就是忘记背后，努力面前的，向着标竿直跑，要得神在基督耶稣里从上面召我来得的奖赏。」
          (腓立比书 3:12-14)。他更欲表明唯此方构成我辈之圆满，遂又补言：「所以我们中间，凡是完全人，总要存这样的心。」 (腓立比书 3:15)。换言之：圆满并非以为已达圆满；德行之境并非停滞不前，而是不断向德行奋力前行。

          and hidden passions, that we do not know them as passions at all. So how
          can we be so presumptuous as to think that we are completely cleansed of
          passions? If even the sharp and prophetic eyes of David could not discern
          them in himself, how can we attribute such capacity of seeing to ourselves?
          Therefore, if even he never ceased to pray God: 『 Cleanse thou me from secret
          faults 『 (Ps. xix. 12), how much more do we need to implore Him to cleanse
          us from our hidden passions? For we sense only the effects and ramifications
          of passions, and can learn to know their strength and their roots only through
          enlightenment by the Holy Spirit. Therefore we are aware of passions in
          ourselves only when they are in action; but as soon as they quieten down,
          we imagine that we have attained passionlessness.'
        cn: 再者，有时在我们心灵深处潜藏着如此细微和隐秘的情欲，以至于我们根本不将其视作情欲。那么，我们怎能如此自大地认为自己已全然洁净，摆脱了情欲呢？如果连大卫那敏锐如先知般的双眼都无法辨识出自己内在的这些情欲，我们又怎能将如此的洞察力归于自身呢？因此，如果连他都从未停止向上帝祈祷：「求你洗涤我隐而未现的罪过」（诗篇
          19:12），我们岂不更需恳求祂洁净我们隐藏的情欲？因为我们只感受到情欲的后果和蔓延，唯有借由圣神的启迪，才能知晓它们的力量和根源。所以，我们只有在情欲发作时才察觉到它们的存在；而一旦它们平息下来，我们便以为自己已臻于无情无欲之境。

        en: 'How can we make sure that passions are not dead in our heart, but merely
          quiescent? By the fact that, when reassured on that score, we chance to
          meet objects, which feed the passions lying hidden in us, especially if
          this happens suddenly, and they immediately come to life and make their
          presence felt, sometimes with quite violent movements, so that, cast into
          turmoil, we wonder where they were hiding and whence they suddenly arose.
          St. Isaac of Syria explains this by the following beautiful illustration:
          in winter herbs and flowers vanish from the face of the earth, yet their
          roots remain safe, hidden in its depth. But as soon as they feel the rains
          and warmth of spring, they immediately begin to sprout and so cover the
          face of the earth. So too with passions . . . And again: as it is natural
          for blighted land to produce thorns and thistles, so it is in a certain
          sense natural for human nature, corrupted by downfall and now conceived
          in sin and open to its stimulus, to produce passions, which give birth to
          sins; hence our nature can never be trusted or relied upon.'
        cn: 我们如何能确定，心中的情欲并非已然消逝，而仅仅是蛰伏 quiescent？便是当我们在那方面得到慰藉后，偶然遇见那些能滋养我们心中隐藏情欲的事物，尤其当此事猝然发生，它们便会立刻苏醒，显露其存在，有时甚至伴随着颇为猛烈的波动，以至于我们陷入纷扰，惊异它们此前藏匿何处，又从何处骤然兴起。叙利亚的圣艾萨克对此用以下优美之喻加以阐明：隆冬时节，草木花卉自大地表面隐匿无踪，然而它们的根茎却安然无恙，深藏于地底。可一旦它们感受到春雨的滋润与暖意，便立刻开始萌发，继而遍布大地。情欲亦是如此……。又曰：正如荒芜之地自然会生出荆棘蒺藜，人类本性亦是如此，它因堕落而败坏，如今在罪中受孕，并向罪的刺激敞开，在某种意义上自然会滋生情欲，而情欲则孕育出罪恶；因此，我们的本性绝不可信赖，亦不可倚靠。

          lest your enemy succeeds in tempting you, or your self-love conceives a
          desire to be rid of it. For then you will suffer a double loss. The first
          is that, although the appearance of such a desire and your consenting to
          it does not immediately rob you of the virtue of patience, it does greatly
          undermine it. Therefore, when desire to be free of the affliction sent to
          you is not fulfilled, your patience gradually weakens and finally brings
          you to a state of impatience. The second is that from that moment your patience
          becomes forced, whereas God loves and rewards what is given freely. Therefore,
          from that moment, although you will still have to endure, for the mere desire
          to be rid of afflictions does not rid one of them, your endurance will be
          unrewarded. God will reward you for enduring your affliction for the time
          you have endured it with a good heart, not seeking deliverance. But from
          the moment this desire came to you, God will grant you no reward for your
          unwilling endurance. But if you stifle and repel the desire to be free from
          your affliction, as soon as it presents itself, and abandon yourself entirely
          to the benevolent will of God, proclaiming your readiness to suffer even
          a hundred times greater sorrows, should God wish to send them to you, then,
          even if your present suffering lasts only an hour or less, God will accept
          it as of the longest duration and will reward you correspondingly.

          us to undertake excessive and untimely efforts for spiritual perfection,

          stand on the summit. Thus he teaches some cruelly to mortify their flesh

          因此，它教唆一些人残酷地苦待他们的肉体，借由禁食、鞭笞、卧于裸地及其他类似的身体磨难，以使他们堕入骄傲，并自以为正成就大事；或使他们因极度疲惫而病倒，变得连最小的义行也无法完成；或使他们因努力的重担而筋疲力尽，对一切灵性上的努力，甚至对救赎本身也变得漠不关心。如此，他们对良善的热情逐渐冷却，最终以比从前更甚的热切投身于肉体的情欲和世俗的享乐。

          asceticism, when there is a need for them. Do not launch out with lofty
          standards, but begin at the bottom; for it is better to climb upwards gradually,
          than suddenly to undertake something lofty and be forced to climb down,
          to your shame. At the same time I advise you also to avoid the other extreme,
          into which even such men fall as are considered spiritual. Ruled by self-pity
          and self-indulgence, they exhibit too great a concern for the preservation
          of their physical health, and take such great care of themselves that they
          tremble at the slightest effort, afraid to impair their health. Nothing
          is more in their thoughts, nothing a more favourite subject of their talk
          than preserving their life Yet, by inventing delicate dishes, which pander
          more to their refined tastes than healthy food, they weaken and often impair
          their health and deprive themselves of the blessing they prize so highly,
          because they cannot do what is necessary to attain it. Although they justify
          their actions by the desire to work better for the Lord, in actual fact
          it is nothing but an effort to reconcile two irreconcilable enemies-flesh
          and spirit, not only with no profit for either, but on the contrary with
          obvious harm to them both alike; since by this they deprive the body of
          health, and the spirit of its salutary state. Therefore a moderate and orderly
          mode of life, controlled by reason, which takes into account the requirements
          of the soul and the particular constitution of the body, together with its
          state of health, are less dangerous and more useful both for the soul and
          for the body. For in this respect the standard is not the same for every
          man, although one law applies to all -to keep the body subservient to the
          spirit. Remember also what was said earlier, that the acquisition of virtues,

          others from on high, judge and despise them, for we seem to ourselves far
          removed from such faults as we think others possess. And here, seeing our
          evil disposition, our ever-wicked enemy stands by watchfully and, opening
          our eyes, teaches us to keep a sharp watch for what others say and do. From
          these observations he makes us draw conclusions as to their thoughts and
          feelings; and, on these suppositions, form an opinion of them, generally
          not good, exaggerating this supposed defect into a deep-rooted feature.
          These judges do not see and realise that the very origin of their judgment,
          the suspicion of wrong in others, is impressed on the mind by the action
          of the enemy, and then fanned by him into a conviction that they are actually
          such, although it is not so at all.
        cn: 因我们如此看重自己，自视甚高，自然就居高临下地看待他人，论断并蔑视他们。因为我们觉得自己与他人所具备的那些过失相去甚远。在此，我们邪恶的性情显露无疑，而我们那永恒的仇敌便警觉地侍立一旁，开启我们的眼睛，教导我们密切留意他人的言行。从这些观察中，他使我们得出关于他们思想和情感的结论；并基于这些臆测，形成对他们的看法，通常都不甚良善，将这假定的缺陷夸大为根深蒂固的特质。这些论断者并未察觉到，他们论断的根源——对他人过错的猜疑——正是仇敌在心中烙印下，并由他煽动成确信，以为他们果真如此，尽管事实并非如此。

          hasten to repel this thought, lest it take root in you and grow. Cast it

          good qualities you know your neighbour to possess, or of those people generally
          should have. If you still feel the impulse to pass judgment, add to this
          the truth, that you are given no authority for this and that the moment
          you assume this authority you thereby make yourself worthy of judgment and
          condemnation, not before powerless men, but before God, the all-powerful

          your mind the memory of your own wickedness, your unclean and evil passions
          and actions, and correspondingly to hold on to the constant realisation
          of your own unworthiness. You will certainly find in yourself no small number
          of such passions and passionate actions. If you have not given up and shrugged
          your shoulders, saying: 『Come what may」, you cannot help caring about finding
          a cure for these ills, which are killing you. But if you act sincerely in
          this, you should have no time free to concern yourself in the affairs of
          others and to pass sentence on them. For then, if you let yourself do this,
          the sayings will keep ringing in your ears: 「Physician, heal thyself」 (Luke

          about others and to judge them. 「An evil man out of the evil treasure」 (of
          the heart) 「bringeth forth evil things 『 (Matt. xii. 35). But an eye, that
          is pure and without passion, looks too without passion on the actions of
          others, and not with evil. 「Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil」
          (Habakkuk i. 13). Therefore when the thought comes to condemn another man
          for some fault, be indignant with yourself as a perpetrator of the same
          actions and guilty of the same fault; and say in your heart: 『 Unworthy
          as I am, how can I raise my head to see the faults of others and accuse
          them, when I am submerged in the same sin and my trespasses are even greater?』
          By doing this you will turn against yourself the weapon, which evil thought

          12:35）。然而，纯洁无瑕、不带情欲的眼睛，在看待他人的行为时，亦是无有情欲，不存邪恶的。「你眼目清洁不看邪恶」（哈巴谷书 1:13）。因此，当谴责他人过犯的念头兴起时，当如犯下同样行径、同有过失者一般，自责不已；并在心中如此说：「我这不配之人，怎能抬起头来察看并指控他人的过失呢？因我亦沉沦于同样的罪孽之中，我的过犯甚至更为深重！」如此行，你便能将那恶念怂恿你用以攻击他人的兵器，转而对准自己；如此，你非但不会伤害你的弟兄，反能医治你自身的创伤。

          no efforts towards it, truly this man tempts God, rather than prays. Thus
          the divine James says: 『The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
          availeth much 『 (James v. 16). What avails to make prayer effective, according
          to St. Maximus, is when, besides begging a saint to pray for him about something,

          5:16）。根据圣马 Maximus 所言，使祷告有效的，除了恳求圣者为他代祷某事之外，更在于此人自己也为此事祷告，并以一切的勤勉，竭尽所能地去做一切必要之事，以求获得所求。

        en: '(7) You should always say your prayers with tireless diligence, as the
          Apostle directs, saying: 『 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same」 (Col.
          iv. 2). For humble patience, tirelessness and persistence in prayer conquer
          the unconquerable God and incline Him to mercy. According to the Lord』s
          parable, the importunity of the widow inclined a wicked and unjust judge
          to grant her petition. The Lord gave this parable for a special purpose-to
          teach us not to faint, but to pray patiently, as we read in the Gospels:
          『 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to
          pray, and not to faint」 (Luke xviii. 1). If, as I say, an unjust judge was
          persuaded to grant the petition of the widow because she importuned him,
          how can God fail to incline His ear to our prayers, if we persist in imploring
          Him since He is the essence of lovingkindness ? Therefore, when you beg
          God to grant you something, and He is slow in hearing you, continue to pray,
          keeping firm trust in His help alive in your heart. For diligent prayer
          is never left by Him unrewarded and He is always ready to pour out rich
          blessings in return, much exceeding the expectations of those who pray,
          if they have no inner obstacles and are not in a state when it is better
          for them that their petition should remain unfulfilled. In this case, instead
          of what they ask, God sends them some other good, more profitable to them,
          whether they are aware of it or not. In this sense the conviction that prayer
          never remains unheard is quite justified; all that happens is that, when
          we ask and are not aware that what we ask is unprofitable to us, God does
          not send what we ask, and what He does send remains unseen, because to see
          it is not without danger to him who receives. So always be patient in prayer,
          and convinced that prayer never remains without fruit. If you do not receive
          what you ask, believe that you are receiving or will receive another good
          in its place. If you do not see it or come to see it, do not try to find
          out why this is so, but turn to your unworthiness and fill your soul with
          humble thoughts and feelings. If you provoke and make firm such thoughts
          in yourself, as a consequence of prayer, then, even if you receive absolutely
          nothing, whether visibly or invisibly, accept these feelings themselves
          as the fruit of prayer, both salutary for yourself and most pleasing to
          God. Hear what St. John Chrysostom says: 『Prayer is a great blessing if
          practised in a right inner state and if we teach ourselves to give thanks
          to God, both when we receive what we ask and when we do not receive it.
          For when He gives, and when He does not give, He does it for your good.
          Thus when you receive what you ask, it is quite clear that you have received
          it; but when you do not receive it, you also receive, because you thus do
          not receive what is undoubtedly harmful for you; and not to receive what
          is harmful means to be granted what is useful. So, whether you receive what
          you ask or not, give thanks to God in the belief that God would have always
          given us what we ask were it not often better for us not to receive it.
          So always pray to God with patience and render thanks to Him for all things,
          believing and professing your belief that He is good to you, and wisely
          good, and is your loving Benefactor, both when He gives and does not give
          what you ask. Firm in this faith, remain humbly obedient to divine Providence,
          meeting gratefully and gladly everything that happens, whether pleasant
          or unpleasant.'
        cn: (7) 你当以不倦之勤恳恒常祷告，正如使徒所教诲：「你们要恒切祷告，在此警醒感恩」（歌罗西书 4:2）。因为谦卑的忍耐、不倦与坚持的祈祷，能征服那不可征服的上帝，使祂转向施恩。按照主所说的比喻，寡妇的纠缠使那邪恶不义的审判官都俯允了她的请求。主讲这个比喻，有一个特别的目的——教导我们不可灰心，而要耐心祷告，正如我们在福音书中所读到的：「耶稣设一个比喻，是要他们常常祷告，不可灰心」（路加福音
          18:1）。如果，如我所言，一个不义的审判官因寡妇的纠缠而被说服允诺她的请求，那么，如果我们在恳求上帝时坚持不懈，祂又怎会不侧耳垂听我们的祷告呢？祂乃是慈爱之本质。因此，当你祈求上帝赐予你某种事物，而祂迟迟不应允时，你当继续祷告，心中坚定地怀揣对祂帮助的信任。因为勤勉的祈祷绝不会不蒙祂的报偿，祂也总是乐意倾注丰盛的恩典作为回报，远远超出那些祷告者的期望，只要他们内心没有障碍，且他们的处境并非所求不应更佳。在此情况下，上帝会赐予他们一些其他更具益处的好处，无论他们是否知晓。从这个意义上说，祷告绝不会不蒙垂听的信念是完全有理由的。所发生的一切，无非是当我们所求之事于我们无益却不自知时，上帝不赐予我们所求，而祂所赐予的却不被看见，因为看见它对领受者而言并非没有危险。所以，务必在祷告中常存忍耐，并深信祷告绝不会没有果效。如果你没有得到所求，请相信你正在或将要得到另一个更好的东西来替代。如果你看不见或未能看见它，不要试图探究缘由，而当转而思量自己的不配，并让谦卑的思想和情感充满你的灵魂。如果你在祷告之后，激发起并坚定这样的思想，那么，即便你完全没有得到任何可见或不可见的事物，也请将这些感受本身接受为祷告的果实，这于你自身有益，且最蒙上帝喜悦。请听圣金口约翰所言：「祷告是一项伟大的恩典，如果以正确的心境实践，并且我们教导自己感恩于上帝，无论我们得到了所求还是没有得到。因为祂赐予，或是不赐予，都是为了你的益处。因此，当你得到所求时，你显然已经得到了；但当你没有得到时，你同样有所得，因为你因此没有得到无疑对你有害之物；而没有得到有害之物，就意味着获得了有益之物。所以，无论你是否得到所求，都要感谢上帝，相信上帝若非常常更好地不赐予我们所求，祂总是会赐予的。所以，总要带着忍耐祷告上帝，为万事感谢祂，相信并宣称你相信祂待你好，且是明智的好，是你的慈爱施恩者，无论祂赐予或不赐予你所求。坚定此信念，谦卑顺服于神圣的旨意，以感恩和喜乐的心情迎接所发生的一切，无论是愉悦还是不悦。」

        en: Mental or inner prayer is when a man at prayer collects his mind in the
          heart, and from there sends out his prayer to God, not aloud but in silent
          words, praising and thanking Him, confessing to Him his sins with contrition
          and begging for his needs in spiritual and bodily blessings. One should
          pray not only in words but also in mind, and not only in mind but also in
          the heart, so that the mind sees and understands clearly what is said in
          words, and the heart feels what the mind thinks. All this yoked together
          is real prayer, and if something of this is lacking in prayer, it is either
          imperfect prayer or not prayer at all.
        cn: 心祷或内祷，乃是祈祷之人将他的心念汇聚于心，并从此处向神献上祷告，非以声言，乃以无声之语，赞美并感谢祂，以悔罪之心向祂忏悔自己的罪愆，并恳求祂赐予灵性与肉身之所需福佑。人当不仅以言语祷告，亦当以心意祷告，不仅以心意祷告，亦当以心祷告，俾使心意清晰洞察并理解言语所道，而心则感受心意所思。凡此种种，若能同心合一，方是真切之祷告。若祷告中有所欠缺，则此祷告或为不全，或根本不为祷告。

          into its component parts? The reason is that owing to our negligence it
          sometimes happens that the tongue says the holy words of prayer, while the
          mind wanders away somewhere: or the mind understands the words of prayer,
          but the heart does not respond to them with feeling. In the first case prayer
          is merely words, and is not prayer at all; in the second-prayer with words
          is connected with mental prayer, and this is imperfect, incomplete prayer.
          Full and real prayer is when praying words and praying thoughts are combined
          with praying feelings.'

        en: 'There is yet another form of prayer, which is called standing in the
          presence of God, when the man who prays is wholly concentrated in his heart
          and inwardly contemplates God as being present to him and within him, with
          corresponding feelings- either of fear of God and the feeling of wonder
          and awe before His greatness, or of faith and hope, or of love and submission
          to His will, or of contrition and readiness for any sacrifice. Such a state
          comes when a man becomes deeply immersed in prayer by word, mind and heart.
          If a man prays in the right way and for a long time, these states come to
          him more and more often, and finally this state can become permanent; then
          it is called walking before God and is constant prayer. This was the state
          of David, who says of himself: 『I have set the Lord always before me: because
          he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved」 (Ps. xvi. 8). Thus, my brother,
          if you wish your prayer to bring much fruit, never be content by oral prayer
          alone, but pray also with your mind and heart-using your mind to understand
          and be conscious of all that is said in words, and your heart to feel it
          all. Above all, pray with your heart. Prayer bursting from the heart is
          like a streak of lightning, which takes but a moment to cross the heavens
          and appear before the throne of the all-merciful God. God hears it and inclines
          towards this most of all. This was the prayer with which Moses prayed standing
          before the Red Sea; and immediately he heard God』s voice: 『 Wherefore criest
          thou unto me?』 (Ex. xiv. 15): and God gave him the power to free his people
          from the danger which threatened them.'
        cn: '尚有一种祷告的形式，称为「立于上帝的临在之中」。此时，祷告之人全然专注于自己的心，内心默观上帝在自己身边，又在自己之内，伴随着相应的感受——或是对上帝的敬畏，以及在其伟大面前的惊奇和崇敬之情；或是信心与盼望；或是爱与顺服其旨意；或是痛悔与乐意献上任何牺牲。这种状态的到来，是在一个人通过言语、心思和心灵，深沉地沉浸于祷告之中时。若人以正确的方式长久祷告，这些状态便会愈发频繁地临到他，最终这种状态能够变为恒常；那时，它便被称为「在上帝面前行走」，是持续不断的祷告。这便是大卫的状态，他如此论及自己：「我将上主常摆在我面前；因他在我右边，我便不致摇动。」
          (诗篇 16:8)。


          因此，我的弟兄啊，如果你希望你的祷告能结出丰盛的果实，切莫只满足于口头的祷告，而要用心思和心灵祷告——运用你的心思去理解并 осознавать
          (意识) 话语中所说的一切，并用你的心灵去感受这一切。最重要的是，用心灵祷告。从心灵迸发而出的祷告，如同划破天际的闪电，只需片刻便能穿过穹苍，显现于至仁慈上帝的宝座前。上帝垂听它，并最倾心于此。摩西站在红海边祷告，便是这种祷告；他立刻听见了上帝的声音：「你为何向我哀求呢？」
          (出埃及记 14:15)；上帝便赐予他能力，使他的百姓脱离了那威胁着他们的危险。'

          prepare yourself: 『 stand for a while in silence, until your feelings calm
          down 『 as the prayer-book teaches, and remember what you arc about to approach
          and to perform, who you are, who are about to pray, and who is He before
          Whom you are about to recite your prayers, what exactly you are to say and
          how. This preparation is made necessary-in the morning, because the soul
          is heavy from immersion in sleep and because the cares of the coming day
          flood you immediately upon awakening- and in the evening by the varied impressions
          of the day, and especially things that stand out as striking, whether pleasant
          or unpleasant. Try to sweep all this out of your consciousness, so that
          the work of prayer occupies your whole attention and you can consecrate
          the time before you exclusively to prayer. If some matters have struck you,

          performed not only in words but also with mind and heart. Prayer of this
          kind captures the whole attention and keeps it within, in the heart. This
          is why to remain within is an inalienable feature of real prayer and its
          chief condition. The thought of God, as being present and listening to prayer,
          and the repulsion of every other thought is inseparable from remaining within
          in prayer. This is called sobriety or guarding of the heart. Therefore all
          the care of a man striving to make progress in prayer must be pre-eminently
          directed and must in fact turn towards this end: that is, never to leave
          the heart, soberly protecting it from every thought, except the thought
          of God alone; and to do whatever one has to do with one』s attention never
          turning away from God, conscious of His presence, as though before His Face.
          This is the highest doing in the work of prayer. Recital of prayer, practised
          in the manner shown above, is the way to this, and even to realising the
          need and necessity for it. It is the first to teach the mind to concentrate
          on the heart and to pay attention exclusively to God. Having learned the
          value of this concentration, it is natural for a man, who practises prayer,
          to wish for it to become a permanent condition of his spirit; for then constant
          prayer would dwell in him; and desire naturally leads to efforts to satisfy
          it. All those who have felt this need have sought and seek this. All instructions
          of the holy fathers concerning sobriety and guarding of the heart lead in
          this direction and have no other source but achievements in this work.'
        cn: 人们已经多次说过，真正的祷告是内在的祷告，不仅仅用言语，更要用心思和心灵来完成。这样的祷告能抓住全部的注意力，并将其保持在内心、在心底。因此，保持在内心是真实祷告不可或缺的特征及其首要条件。在祷告中保持在内心，与思想着上帝的临在和垂听，并排斥一切其他思虑，是密不可分的。这被称为警醒或守护心。所以，一个人若渴望在祷告中有所精进，他全部的心思必须主要导向并实际转向这个目标：那就是，永不离开内心，警醒地守护它，使其免受一切思虑，唯独思想上帝；并以不曾远离上帝的注意力来做一切必须做的事情，意识到祂的临在，如同在祂面前一般。这是祷告工作中最高的行持。如上所述的祷告诵念，是通往此境的途径，甚至能让人认识到其必要性和必需性。它首先教导心思专注于内心，并唯独专注于上帝。当一个人领会了这种专注的价值后，他自然会渴望它成为他灵性的恒常状态；因为那时，恒常的祷告将住在他里面；而愿望自然会驱使他努力去满足它。所有那些感受到这种需要的人都曾寻求并仍在寻求它。圣教父们关于警醒和守护内心的一切教导都指向这个方向，并且除了在这项工作中取得的成就，别无他源。

        en: 'If you too feel this need, then you will ask: how to achieve this constant
          abiding within, before God』s face, with sober guarding of the heart? Recital
          of prayer opens the way and produces the rudiments, but does not reach the
          end itself, or does not bring it to the required force and perfection. Recital
          of prayers is complex. It contains and offers to the attention many subjects
          which, although holy, may remind one of others, belonging to daily life
          or social life, and lead through these to worldly, irrelevant subjects,
          in accordance with the usual laws of association of thoughts and visualisations.
          And so it happens; the most assiduous recital of prayer can never be practised
          without the thought darting away and wandering outside. Since this disturbs
          the prayer and makes it impure, there is no man who practises prayer, who
          is not chagrined by it and does not wish to be delivered from this incapacity.
          Attention was drawn to this from the very earliest days of the life of spiritual
          endeavour. Then what method, following recital of prayer, was invented to
          cure it? The method was invented of saying short prayers, which would keep
          the thought always within, before God』s face, and would thus give it no
          chance of straying, nor of going outside. St. Cassian speaks of this, saying
          that in his time this practice was general in Egypt (Discourses x. 10).
          From the teachings of other fathers we see that it was used on Mount Sinai,
          in Palestine, in Syria, and in all other places throughout the Christian
          world. What other meaning have the invocation: 『Lord have mercy!」 and other
          short prayers, which fill our divine services and our psalmody? Thus, here
          is my advice: choose for yourself a short prayer or several such prayers,
          and by their frequent repetition arrive at the stage when they go on repeating
          by themselves on your tongue, and keep your thought focused on one point
          only-remembrance of God.'
        cn: 倘若你亦感到此番需求，你便会发问：如何才能恒常地安住于此，在上帝的面前，以清醒的心灵守护？诵念祷文开启了道路，孕育了雏形，但却未能直抵终极，亦未能将其推至所需的力道与圆满。诵念祷文是复杂的。它包罗万象，向心神呈现诸多主题，这些主题虽属神圣，却可能令人联想到其他日常或社交生活之事，并循此将思绪引向世俗、无关紧要的课题，此乃循着思想与意象关联的寻常法则。而事实亦是如此；即便最勤恳的祷文诵念，也绝不可能毫无思绪的游离与外驰。由于这扰乱了祷告，使其变得不洁，故而没有一个祷告之人不为此而烦恼，不渴望摆脱此番无能。早在灵修生活的最初时日，人们便已对此予以关注。那么，继诵念祷文之后，又发明了何种方法来匡正此弊呢？所发明的方法便是诵念简短的祷文，这些祷文能使思绪恒常地安住于内，在上帝的面前，从而不给它丝毫游荡或外驰的机会。圣卡西安谈及此事时说，在他那个时代，这种做法在埃及十分普遍（《论道集》第十卷，第十节）。从其他教父的教诲中我们看到，它在西奈山、巴勒斯坦、叙利亚以及基督教世界的所有其他地方都被广泛采用。那么，「主啊，怜悯！」以及其他那些充斥着我们的圣礼和圣咏的简短祷文，又有什么其他的意义呢？因此，我的建议是：为你自己选择一句或几句简短的祷文，并通过频繁的重复，达到它们能在你的舌尖上自行重复的境界，并使你的思绪仅仅专注于一点——对上帝的忆念。

        en: But do not have too many, lest you overburden your memory and lest your
          attention runs from one to the other, which will be totally contrary to
          the purpose for which they were designed-to keep attention collected. The
          24 prayers of St. Chrysostom is the maximum; one can use less. To have more
          than one is good for variety and to enliven spiritual taste; but in using
          them one should not pass from one to another too quickly. Taking one which
          corresponds best to your spiritual need, appeal to God with it until your
          taste for it becomes blunted. You can replace all your psalmody, or part
          of it, by these short prayers; make it a rule to repeat them several times-ten,
          fifty and a hundred times, with lesser bows. But always keep one thing in
          mind-to hold your attention constantly directed towards God.
        cn: 但不要拥有太多，以免你的记忆不堪重负，也以免你的注意力从一个祷文转到另一个祷文，这与它们设计的初衷——保持注意力集中——完全背道而驰。圣金口若望的二十四篇祷文是上限；你可以使用更少的。拥有不止一篇祷文有益于增添多样性并活跃属灵的味觉；但在使用它们时，不应太快地从一篇转到另一篇。选择一篇最符合你属灵需求的祷文，以此向神祈求，直到你对它的兴趣变得迟钝。你可以用这些短祷文来取代你全部或部分的诗篇诵读；制定一个规则，重复它们多次——十次、五十次、一百次，并辅以较小的俯身。但务必始终牢记一件事——持续地将你的注意力指向神。

        en: 'There have been and still are men of prayer who preferred one short prayer
          and repeated it constantly. St. Cassian says that the prayer usually repeated
          in his time by everyone in Egypt was the first verse of Psalm lxx: 『 Make
          haste, 0 God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, 0 Lord.」 It is written
          in the life of St. Joanniky that he repeated the following prayer: 『 The
          Father is my hope, the Son is my refuge, the Holy Spirit is my protection.」
          He also added it to each verse of the thirty psalms he learnt by heart,
          which constituted his rule of prayer. Another constantly used as prayer
          the following words: 『 Being a man I have sinned; but Thou, being God the
          Compassionate, have mercy on me.』 Others, of course, preferred other prayers.
          From the most ancient times the prayer chosen by a great many was: 『Lord
          Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.」 We find indications
          of it in St. Ephrem, St. Chrysostom, St. Isaac of Syria, St. Hesychius,
          St. Barsanuphius and John, and St. John of the Ladder. Later it became more
          and more general, began to be on everyone』s lips and became part of the
          Church』s statutes, where it is offered in place of all prayers said at home
          and of all church services. This is why it is now used with us more than
          any other short prayer. I advise you too to acquire the habit of it.'
        cn: 过去和现在都有一些祷告者，他们偏爱一句简短的祷告，并不断重复。圣卡西安说，在他那个时代，埃及的每个人通常重复的祷告是诗篇七十篇的第一节：「神啊，求你快快搭救我！上主啊，求你速速帮助我！」
          在圣约阿尼基的生平中记载，他重复以下的祷告：「父是我的希望，子是我的避难所，圣灵是我的庇护。」 他还将此祷告加在他所熟记的三十篇诗篇的每一节之后，这构成了他的祷告规程。另一些人则不断地使用以下的话语作为祷告：「我身为凡人犯了罪；而祢，身为慈悲的神，求祢怜悯我。」
          当然，其他人则偏爱其他祷告。从最古老的时代起，许多人选择的祷告是：「主耶稣基督，神的儿子，求祢怜悯我这罪人。」 我们在圣以弗拉因、圣金口若望、叙利亚的圣以撒、圣赫西基乌、圣巴尔萨努菲和若望，以及阶梯的圣约翰的著作中都找到了它的痕迹。后来，它变得越来越普遍，开始被所有人挂在嘴边，并成为教会规章的一部分，在那里，它被用以取代所有在家中进行的祷告和所有教堂的礼仪。这就是为什么它现在在我们这里比任何其他短祷告使用得更多。我也建议你养成这个习惯。

        en: 'This prayer was called the Jesus Prayer because it is addressed to our
          Lord Jesus. Like any other short prayer, it is verbal; but it becomes and
          should be called mental, when it is said not only in words, but also in
          mind and heart, with both consciousness and feeling of its content, and
          especially if, through long and attentive practice, it becomes so merged
          with the movements of the spirit, that the words disappear and only these
          movements are seen within.-Every short prayer can reach this degree. Pre-eminence
          belongs to the Jesus prayer because it unites the soul with our Lord Jesus,
          and the Lord Jesus is the only door to union with God, which is the aim
          of prayer. For He Himself said: 『No man cometh unto the Father, but by me』
          (John xiv. 6). Thus a man, who acquires it, acquires also the whole force
          of dispensation by incarnation; and in this lies our salvation. Hearing
          this, you will not be surprised that those who strove after salvation neglected
          no effort in trying to form the habit of this prayer and to become possessed
          of its power. You too should imitate their example.'
        cn: '这祷文之所以被称为耶稣祷文，乃因其指向我主耶稣。如同任何简短的祷文，它是口头的；但当它不仅以言语，更以心思和心肠，带着对其内容的意识与感受而被诵念时，它便成为，也应当被称为心意上的祷文。尤其当它，通过长久而专注的操练，与灵的活动如此融合，以至言语消逝，唯有这些活动在内心显现时，更是如此。


          任何简短的祷文都能达到这个境界。而耶稣祷文的卓越之处在于它将灵魂与我主耶稣联合，而主耶稣是通往与上帝联合的唯一门户，这正是祷告的目的。因为祂自己曾说：「若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去」（约翰福音
          14:6）。因此，一个人若获得了它，也就获得了道成肉身之救赎的所有力量；而这正是我们救恩之所在。


          听到这些，你便不会惊讶那些寻求救恩之人，为了养成这祷文的习惯并获得其力量，不遗余力地付出了努力。你也应当效仿他们的榜样。'

        en: Externally, acquiring the habit of this prayer consists in reaching the
          point where it turns on your tongue constantly by itself; internally, it
          consists in concentrating the attention of the mind in the heart and in
          constantly standing there in the presence of the Lord, with varying degrees
          of heartfelt warmth, repulsing all other thoughts, and above all falling
          at the feet of our Lord and Saviour with contrition and humility. The first
          step towards this habit is to repeat this prayer as often as possible with
          attention in the heart. Frequent repetition, becoming established, collects
          the mind into one, standing in the presence of the Lord. Establishing this
          order within is accompanied by warmth of heart and by repelling of all thoughts,
          even simple and not only passionate ones. When the flame of cleaving to
          the Lord begins to be constantly alight in the heart, then, together with
          this, a peaceful ordering of the heart will be established within, with
          contrite and humble inner prostration before the Lord. We are brought thus
          far by our own efforts with the help of Divine grace. Anything beyond this
          which may be attained in the work of prayer will be a gift of grace alone.
          The holy fathers mention this only lest, having reached this limit, a man
          thinks that he has nothing further to wish for and imagines that he has
          attained the summit of perfection in prayer, or in spiritual achievement.
        cn: 此番祈祷，其外在习惯的养成，在于臻至舌端自然流转，恒常不辍之境；其内在习惯的养成，则在于心神专注汇聚于心，恒久立于主之座前，怀揣或深或浅之赤诚暖意，摈弃一切他念，尤须以痛悔谦卑之心，俯伏于我主救主足下。迈向此习惯之首要一步，便是以虔敬之心，尽其所能，频频于心中复诵此祷。勤恳复诵，一旦根植，便能集聚心神，使其专一，立于主之临在之中。此内在秩序之确立，伴随心田之温暖，并能驱散一切思绪，乃至平淡之念，遑论激情之思。当那依恋吾主之焰，开始于心间恒久燃炽，届时，一股宁静的心灵秩序亦将随之在内确立，带着痛悔与谦卑，于主前俯伏叩拜。我们凭藉自身努力，辅以神恩之助，方能达至此境。凡在此祈祷功夫上所能成就超越此限者，皆为恩典之独赐。圣教父们提及此事，仅为避免世人一旦抵达此界，便以为别无所求，自诩已臻祈祷或灵性成就之巅峰。

          small, it must be the main impelling force, together with fear of God and
          unshaken trust.

          with the Jesus prayer, omitting nothing which can be of help in this work.
          And you will receive what you seek. I remind you of the words of St. Macarius
          of Egypt: God will see your work of prayer and that you sincerely wish to
          succeed in prayer- and He will give you prayer. For you must know that,
          although prayer done and achieved with one』s own efforts is pleasing to
          God, yet that real prayer, which comes to dwell in the heart and becomes
          constant, is the gift of God, an act of Divine grace. Therefore, in your
          prayer for all other things, do not forget to pray too about prayer.'

        en: '(6) I shall repeat to you what I heard from a God-loving man. 『I was
          not leading a very good life,』 he said, 『but God had mercy on me and sent
          me the spirit of repentance. This was during preparation for communion.
          I was trying hard to plant in myself a firm resolve to mend my ways, and
          especially before confession I prayed for a long time before the Icon of
          the Mother of God, begging Her to obtain this resolve for me. Then, during
          confession, I candidly related everything. My spiritual Father said nothing:
          but while he was reciting the prayer of absolution over my head, a small
          sweet flame was lit in my heart. The sensation was like swallowing some
          delectable food. This little flame remained in the heart, and I felt as
          though someone was gripping my heart. From that time I prayed continuously,
          and kept my attention there, where this sensation was, my only care being
          to preserve it. And God helped me. I had not heard about the Jesus prayer,
          and when I did hear of it, I saw that what was within me was precisely that
          which is sought by this prayer.」 I mention this story to make you understand
          what the work of prayer seeks and what are the signs that it is received,'
        cn: (6) 我要向你重述我从一位敬爱上帝之人那里听来的话。他说：「我过去的生活并不端正，但上帝怜悯了我，赐予我悔改之灵。这发生在我预备领圣体期间。我竭力在心中培植一个坚定的决心，要改过自新。尤其是在告解之前，我在上帝之母圣像前长时间祈祷，恳求她为我求得这个决心。随后，在告解时，我坦诚地述说了我的一切。我的神父一言未发；但当他在我头上诵念赦罪祷文时，一小股甘甜的火焰在我心中燃起。那感觉就像是吞咽了某种美味的食物。这小小的火焰留在了心中，我感到好像有人紧握着我的心。从那时起，我便持续不断地祈祷，并将我的注意力集中在那份感受所在之处，我唯一的挂虑就是保守它。上帝也帮助了我。我当时从未听闻过耶稣祷文，而当我听闻时，我才明白我心中所有的正是此祷文所寻求的。」
          我提及这个故事，是为了让你明白祷告的功夫所追求的是什么，以及它被领受的征兆是什么。

        en: '『Grace abides in us from the time of our holy baptism; but, through our
          inattention, vanity and the wrong life we lead it is stifled, or buried.
          When a man resolves to lead a righteous life and is zealous for salvation,
          the fruit of his whole labour is, therefore, the restoration in force of
          this gift of grace. It comes to pass in a two-fold manner: first, this gift
          becomes revealed through many labours in following the commandments; in
          so far as a man succeeds in following the commandments, this gift becomes
          more radiant and brilliant. Secondly, it manifests and reveals itself through
          constant invocation of the Lord Jesus in prayer. The first method is powerful,
          but the second is more so, so that even the first method gains power through
          it. Thus, if we sincerely wish to open the seed of grace concealed in us,
          let us hasten to train ourselves in this latter exercise of the heart, and
          let us have only this work of prayer in our heart, without forms, without
          images, till it warms our heart and makes it burn with ineffable love of

          in what way prayer can help in it, all you have heard of was how to make
          prayer real prayer. Do not be surprised, for prayer can become a victorious
          weapon in unseen warfare only when it becomes real, that is, when it takes
          root in the heart and begins to act there unceasingly. From that moment
          it becomes an impenetrable, unconquerable and insuperable barrier, protecting
          the soul from the arrows of the enemy, the passionate assaults of the flesh,
          and the enticements of the world with its prelest. Its very presence in
          the heart cuts off the unseen warfare. This is why you were advised to make
          haste and graft the action of prayer on to your heart, and to see that it
          should remain in ceaseless movement. For this is the same as to say: do

          respite from war, or threat of war. Does prayer help at this stage? Assuredly:
          and more so than any other weapon of spiritual warfare. It always attracts
          Divine help, and God』s power repulses the enemies, so long as it is practised
          with zeal and with surrender to God』s will. Its place is at the very forefront
          of resistance to enemy attacks. This is how matters go. When, like a watchful
          sentry, attention sounds the alarm about the approaching enemy, and enemy
          arrows begin to be felt, that is, either a passionate thought or stirrings
          of passion appear within, the spirit, aflame with zeal for salvation, recognises
          it to be the evil doing of the enemy and, by straining its powers to the
          utmost, mercilessly repulses it from the heart, not letting it penetrate
          within. At the same moment, almost as one and the same inner action, it
          ascends to God in prayer, calling for His help. Help comes, enemies are
          dispersed, and the battle subsides.'

        en: 'So far, dear reader, I have spoken to you of the four weapons required
          to overcome the enemies in unseen warfare, namely non-reliance on oneself,
          an unshakeable hope in God, resisting and struggling with sin, and prayer.
          Now I want to indicate to you another powerful weapon in this warfare, namely,
          the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist. This sacrament is the highest
          among sacraments, and is the most powerful and effective of all spiritual
          weapons. The four weapons of which we have spoken receive their power from
          the forces and gifts of grace, obtained for us by the blood of Christ. But
          this sacrament is Christ』s blood itself, and His flesh itself, in which
          Christ is Himself present as God. When we use those four weapons, we fight
          the enemy with the power of Christ; in the latter case our Lord Christ Himself
          strikes down our enemies through us, or in company with us. For he who eats
          Christ』s flesh and drinks His blood abides with Christ, and He in him, as
          He said: 『He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,
          and I in him」 (John vi. 56). Therefore, when we overcome the enemies, it
          is the blood of Christ which overcomes, as it is written in Revelation:
          『and they overcame him」 (the slanderous devil) 『by the blood of the Lamb』
          (Rev. xii. 11).'
        cn: 亲爱的读者，至此我已向你讲述了在不可见的争战中克敌制胜所需的四种武器，即：不倚赖自己、对上帝坚定不移的盼望、抵制并与罪恶抗争，以及祷告。现在，我愿再向你指出此争战中另一件强大的武器，那便是至圣的圣体圣事。这圣事是诸圣事中至高无上的，也是所有属灵武器中最强大、最有效的。我们所谈及的四种武器，其力量源于藉基督宝血为我们所获得的恩典之力与恩赐。然而，此圣事本身即是基督的宝血与圣体，基督作为上帝亲自临在于其中。当我们运用那四种武器时，我们是以基督的能力与仇敌争战；而在后一种情形中，我们的主基督亲自藉我们，或与我们一同击溃我们的仇敌。因为那吃基督的肉、喝基督的血之人，便住在基督里面，基督也住在他里面，正如祂所说：「吃我肉喝我血的人，常在我里面，我也常在他里面」（约翰福音
          6:56）。因此，当我们战胜仇敌时，乃是基督的宝血战胜，正如启示录中所载：「弟兄胜过他（那控告者魔鬼），是因羔羊的血」（启示录 12:11）。

        en: 'This desire of the Lord is so great and ardent that no created mind can
          contain it in its perfection. Yet, in order to move even a little towards
          this understanding, you must try to impress deeply in your mind the following
          two thoughts: first, what unutterable delight it is for the all-merciful
          God to be in most sincere communion with us, as the holy Wisdom Itself testifies,
          saying: 『And my delights were with the sons of men 『 (Prov. viii. 31); and
          second, how strongly God hates sin, both because it prevents his union with
          us, so desirable to Him, and because it is directly opposed to His divine
          perfections. Since His nature is infinitely blessed, pure light and ineffable
          beauty, He cannot but totally abhor sin, which is nothing but the extreme
          of evil, darkness, corruption, abomination and shame in our souls. God』s
          abhorrence of sin is so great that from the very beginning all the acts
          of divine Providence for us and all the ordinances of the Old and New Testaments
          were directed towards exterminating sin and wiping out its traces. Most
          of all is this true of the most wondrous passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
          Son of God and God. Some theologians and teachers say even that if it were
          necessary, our Lord Jesus would be ready to take upon Himself endless other
          deaths to destroy the power of sin (recall the saying of St. Dionysius the
          Areopagite about the vision of Titus). This is how the wrath of God pursues
          it.'
        cn: 主这渴望是如此深切而炽热，没有任何受造的心智能够全然领悟。然而，为了稍稍接近这理解，你必须努力将以下两点深刻铭刻于心：第一，对于全仁慈的上帝而言，能与我们进行最真诚的交融，是何等无法言喻的喜悦，正如圣智本身所见证的，祂说：「我的喜悦，是与世人同在」（箴言
          8:31）；第二，上帝是何等深恶痛绝罪恶，这不仅因为它阻碍了祂与我们之间那份祂所渴望的结合，也因为它直接与祂的神圣完美相对。由于祂的本质是无限的至福、纯粹的光和无法言说的美，祂怎能不全然厌恶罪恶呢？罪恶无非是我们灵魂中极端的邪恶、黑暗、腐败、可憎与羞耻。上帝对罪恶的憎恶是如此深重，以至于从一开始，所有神圣普照我们之作为，以及旧约和新约的所有律法，都是为了根除罪恶，涤净其痕迹。最甚者，莫过于我们救主耶稣基督——神的儿子，亦是上帝——那最奇妙的受难。一些神学家和教导者甚至说，若有必要，我们的主耶稣也愿承受无数次其他的死亡，以摧毁罪恶的权势（请回想圣大迪奥尼修斯·阿雷奥帕吉特关于提多异象的论述）。上帝的怒火追逐罪恶，便是如此。

          desire to enter your heart, to gain there a final victory over your enemies,
          who are His enemies also, you cannot help feeling an ardent desire to receive
          Him into yourself, in order that He should accomplish in you such a deed
          in actual fact. Thus fully inspired by courage and filled with daring by
          the sure hope that the heavenly Commander, your Jesus, can enter you, frequently
          challenge to a fight the passion which troubles you most and which you wish
          to overcome, and strike it down with hatred, contempt and disgust, at the
          same time rousing in yourself the prayerful desire for the opposite virtue,
          and the readiness to do corresponding deeds, precisely such and such. This
          is what you should do on the eve of communion. In the morning, a little
          before the Holy Communion, make a mental survey of all the times when you
          were carried away, did wrong, or sinned, from the time of your last communion
          till now. Remember also the blindness and foolhardiness with which all this
          was done, as though for you there were no God, Who judges and rewards. Who
          has seen it all and Who has borne terrible tortures and a shameful death
          on the cross to deliver you from such things. Realise that you scorned all
          this every time you inclined towards sin and put your own shameful lusts
          above the will of your God and Saviour. Let the face of your soul be covered
          with shame when you realise such ingratitude and foolhardiness. Yet do not
          let yourself be overwhelmed by the disturbance of all this, and cast out
          any hopelessness. In His infinite long-suffering the Lord sees your repentance
          and your profession of readiness to serve henceforth Him alone, He inclines
          towards mercy and hastens towards you and into you, in order to engulf and
          drown in the immensity of His loving kindness the immensity of your ingratitude,
          your foolhardiness and lack of faith. So approach Him with the humble feeling
          of unworthiness, but with full hope, love and devotion, preparing a spacious
          tabernacle for Him in your heart, to let the whole of Him enter you. How
          and in what way? Ây banishing from the heart not only passionate attachment
          to and sympathy for any created thing, but even all thought of such, and
          by closing its door, to prevent anyone or anything entering it, except the
          Lord alone.

          到了早晨，在领受圣餐前片刻，你当在心中回顾自上次领圣餐至今，所有你曾被诱惑、犯错或犯罪的时刻。也要记起所有这一切发生时的盲目与愚鲁，仿佛于你而言，并无一位审判和赏赐的上帝，祂洞察一切，且为救你脱离这些，承受了可怖的苦难与十字架上可耻的死亡。要认识到，每当你倾向于罪，将自己可耻的情欲置于你的上帝与救主旨意之上时，你便蔑视了这一切。当你意识到这般的忘恩负义与愚鲁时，让你的灵魂之面蒙上羞耻。然而，不要让这一切的搅扰将你淹没，并要驱除一切绝望。在祂无限的恒忍中，主看见你的悔改，以及你矢志从此只事奉祂的宣告，祂便倾向于怜悯，并急切地奔向你，进入你内，以便在祂慈爱的浩瀚中，将你那无边的忘恩负义、愚鲁与不信全然吞没与淹没。


          因此，你当怀着谦卑的无价值感，却满怀盼望、爱与虔诚地接近祂，在你的心中为祂预备一个宽敞的帐幕，让祂全然进入你内。如何做到？又以何种方式？便是从心中驱逐不仅是对任何受造物的激情依恋与同情，甚至连一切此类念头也要驱逐，并关上心门，阻止任何人或物进入，除了主以外。'

          Only-begotten Son to live thirty-three years on earth to deliver you, and,
          by terrible torment and painful death on the cross, to redeem and snatch
          you out of the hands of the devil, to whom you became enslaved through sin,

          than the sun, purity beyond all comprehension, compared with which all created
          purity is filth. In His love for you He took the form of a slave, chose
          to be despised, scorned and crucified by the malice of the lawless world,
          and at the same time remained God, holding in His hand the life and death
          of the whole world. And who are you? You are-nothing, who in your corruption,
          evil and malice have become less than nothing, worse than the least and
          most unclean of all creatures, the laughing stock of the demons of hell.
          Carried away by your fantasies and lusts, you have scorned your great Lord
          and Benefactor and, instead of giving thanks to the bountiful God for so
          many and such great favours, you have trodden under foot His priceless blood,
          spilt for your sake. Yet, in spite of it all, He is calling you to His divine
          supper in His unceasing and unchanging love for you. At times He even forces
          you to approach it by fearful admonitions, reminding you of His words said
          to all: 『Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
          ye have no life in you」 (John vi. 53); and just as He does not shut to you
          the door of His mercy, so He does not turn His face away from you, even
          though, in your sins, you are a leper, weak, blind and poor, a slave to
          all passions and vices.'

          6:53）；正如祂不向你关闭祂怜悯的门，祂也不向你转离祂的面，即便你在你的罪中，如一个麻风病人，软弱、盲目、贫穷，是所有情欲和恶习的奴仆。

          by the Holy Communion, basing it on the words of St. Paul that those who
          eat the flesh of the Lord and drink His blood show the Lord』s death (I Cor.
          xi. 26). This death was suffered by the Lord for the sake of all men, and
          so also for the communicants. For what purpose? 『 That they which live should
          not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and
          rose again』 (II Cor. v. 15). So those who approach the Holy Communion with

          to every clear manifestation of His will, that they are prepared to lay
          down their lives for it, undertake the task no longer to live either for

          5:15）。因此，凡怀着信心、爱心，并以顺从神诫命及神旨意一切清晰彰显的决心，甚至为此甘愿舍弃生命的人，前来领受圣餐，他们所承担的使命便是：不再为自己、不再为世界、不再为罪而活，乃是为在圣餐中领受于己身的主神而活，祂为他们死而复活。

          every blessing we receive from His munificent hand, whether visible or invisible,
          for every right action, for every right effort and for every victory over
          the enemies of our salvation, as we were directed: 『In every thing give
          thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you』 (I Thess.
          v. 18). So take care to keep feelings of gratitude to God warm from the
          first moment of awakening from sleep and throughout the day, and go to sleep
          with words of thanks on your lips. For you are immersed in Divine blessings,
          one of which is sleep itself.'
        cn: 我们所拥有的一切祝福，以及我们所行的一切善事，皆源于上帝并来自上帝。因此，我们有责任为一切向祂献上感谢：为我们从祂慷慨之手所领受的每一项祝福，无论是可见的还是无形的；为每一个正确的行动，为每一次正确的努力，以及为每一次战胜我们救恩之敌的胜利，正如我们所受的指示：「凡事谢恩；因为这是上帝在基督耶稣里向你们所定的旨意」（帖撒罗尼迦前书
          5:18）。所以，务请留意，自你从睡梦中醒来的那一刻起，直至全日，都要保持对上帝感恩之情的热忱，并且在口中带着感谢的话语入睡。因为你沉浸在上帝的恩典之中，而睡眠本身便是其中之一。

          blessings. And the place to receive and store these blessings in you is
          a grateful heart. 『 The best way of preserving the benevolence of a benefactor,』
          says St. Chrysostom, 『is remembrance of his favour and constantly giving
          thanks.』 And St. Isaac writes: 『The gratitude of the receiver encourages
          the giver to bestow greater gifts than before. He who is not grateful for
          little will be disappointed in his hopes of much. A gift is always increased,
          except when there is no gratitude.』 St. Basil the Great adds to it a useful
          warning, saying: 『If we do not give thanks for the blessings given by God,
          it becomes necessary to withdraw these blessings in order to bring us to
          our senses. As the eyes fail to see what is too near, but need a suitable
          distance, so ungrateful souls, when deprived of blessings, often become
          aware of former mercies: and while they had no gratitude to the Giver when
          they enjoyed the gifts, they glorify the past when they have lost if (ch.
          On giving thanks, p. 74, Vol. 4).'
        cn: 神并非需要你的感谢：而是你极度需要神圣的赐福。在你之内，领受并珍藏这些赐福的所在，便是一颗感恩的心。圣金口若望言道：「维系施恩者仁慈的最好方法，便是铭记其恩惠并恒常称谢。」圣艾萨克亦写道：「受惠者的感恩，会鼓励施恩者赐予比以往更丰厚的礼物。对微小之物不怀感恩者，其对丰盛的希望必将落空。礼物总会增添，除非没有感恩。」圣巴西尔大帝在此基础上，增添了一个有益的警示，他说：「若我们不为神所赐的恩福献上感谢，便有必要撤回这些恩福，以使我们清醒。正如眼睛无法看清过近之物，需要适当的距离方能明察，同样，不知感恩的灵魂，在被剥夺恩福之后，往往才觉察到昔日的慈悲：当他们享用恩赐之时，对施予者毫无感恩，而当他们失去之时，却将往昔颂扬」（《论感恩》，第74页，卷4）。

          non-being we were brought into being, were created in the image of the Creator,
          were endowed with mind and speech, which constitute the perfection of our
          nature and give us knowledge of God. To diligent study, the beauties of
          creation are like a book showing us the greatness of God』s Providence in
          all things, and His Wisdom. We can discern good from evil; nature itself
          teaches us to chose what is useful and turn away from the harmful. Being
          estranged from God by sin, we are recalled to communion with Him, freed
          from ignominious slavery by the blood of His Only-begotten Son. And what
          of the hope of salvation and the delights of angelic bliss; what of the
          kingdom of heaven and the promised blessings, surpassing all word or understanding!』
          (ibid. p. 51). Read this description of God』s favours towards us, or choose
          another one, or compose one yourself, including in it the blessings which
          God has given you personally. Repeat them often in word and thought, not
          only every day, but many times a day, and you will always have the feeling
          of gratitude to God.'
        cn: 请倾听我的话语，你或许会问：「我如何才能在内心燃起感恩之情并使之常存不灭呢？」请你细察上帝赐予人类——我们这个族类——以及你自身的所有恩惠，并反复在思绪中默念，在记忆里重温；如果你有一颗心，你就无法抑制地向神献唱你的感谢。你会在祷告和圣徒的著作中找到这类赞美诗的范例。请听圣巴西尔大帝如何描述上帝对我们慷慨的赐予：「我们从虚无中被带入存在，被创造为造物主的形像，被赋予理智和言语，这构成了我们本性的完美，并使我们得以认识上帝。对于勤勉的学习者而言，创造之美犹如一本典籍，向我们展示着上帝在万事万物中伟大的眷顾和祂的智慧。我们能够辨别善恶；自然本身教导我们选择有益的并远离有害的。因罪孽而与上帝疏远，我们却被召回与祂的交通之中，借着祂独生子的宝血从可耻的奴役中被释放。还有那救赎的希望和天使般福乐的喜悦；还有那天国和所应许的福祉，超越了一切言语或理解！」
          (同上，第51页)。请阅读这段关于上帝对我们恩惠的描述，或者选择另一段，或者你自己创作一段，将上帝亲自赐予你的福祉包含在内。经常在言语和思想中重复它们，不仅是每天，而且是每天多次，你将永远对上帝怀有感恩之情。

          This work and labour begins in the sweat of the brow. Commandments are not
          hard in themselves, but there are many obstacles to practising them in the
          external circumstances of the struggler, and especially in his inner tendencies
          and habits. With God』s help a tireless struggler overcomes everything in
          the end and achieves peace within and a calm flow of events without-relatively,
          of course.
        cn: 当一个人悔改后，他便将自己奉献于侍奉上帝；而这侍奉随即以遵行上帝的诫命和旨意而开始。此项劳作与辛勤始于额头的汗珠。诫命本身并非艰难，但对于奋斗者而言，其外在境遇，尤其是内在的倾向与习性，却为实践诫命设置了诸多障碍。籍由上帝的帮助，一位不倦的奋斗者终将克服一切，并在内心寻得平安，在外境体验到相对平静的事件流淌，这自然是相对而言。

        en: The struggler always acts himself, although with the help of God. But
          the experience of the first days makes him realise that in spite of all
          his efforts if anything good is done, it is done only because he is given
          force from above to do it. The further he goes, the more this conviction
          grows and becomes deeply rooted. When comparative peace is established within,
          this conviction is emphasized and takes command, until finally it ends in
          complete submission to God』s will, or in total surrender to His influence.
          God』s influence begins to act in those who struggle for salvation from the
          first moments of their turning to God, and it effects the turning itself.
          But it begins to grow as the struggler turns further and further away from
          himself and cleaves to God and, realising his own impotence, has an ever
          firmer trust in God』s power. When at last he surrenders himself entirely
          to God, God is actively present in him, both in showing what he must do
          and in fulfilling it. This is the summit of Christian perfection, in which
          『it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do』 (Phil. ö. 13). As
          was said in the beginning, the seed of this perfection lies in non-reliance
          on oneself and in hope in God; but here it is shown in full maturity.
        cn: 那奋斗者总是在行动，即便有上帝的帮助。然而，最初几日的经验会让他明白，尽管他竭尽全力，若有任何美善之事成就，那只是因为他蒙得了从上而来的力量去完成它。他越往前行，这种确信就越发增长并根深蒂固。当内在相对的平安得以建立时，这种确信便被强调并占据主导，直到最终以完全顺服上帝的旨意，或全然降服于祂的影响而告终。上帝的影响在那些从最初转向祂的那一刻起，便为救赎而奋斗的人心中开始运作，并且它也促成了这转向本身。但随着奋斗者越来越远离自身，并依附于上帝，认识到自己的无能，对上帝的能力怀有愈发坚定的信赖时，这影响便开始增长。当他最终将自己完全交托给上帝时，上帝便积极地临在于他之内，无论是指引他当做什么，还是帮助他完成它。这便是基督徒完美的巅峰，在此境地中，「乃是上帝在你们心里运行，使你们又立志又行事」（腓立比书
          2:13）。正如开篇所言，这完美的种子在于不倚靠自己而在于仰望上帝；但在此处，它已展现出完全的成熟。

        en: Just as the presence of spiritual warmth in the heart is sweet, so is
          its absence bitter, wearisome and frightening. It has been said already
          that it goes when attention and heart deviate from things of the spirit
          and turn towards things not of the spirit. By this is meant not something
          sinful-since a man who has had a taste of spiritual warmth is no longer
          attracted by sin-but all the soul-body realm, vain, earthly, created. As
          soon as attention inclines towards it, spiritual warmth immediately declines;
          but when the heart also cleaves to it, it withdraws altogether, leaving
          behind coldness towards all things divine and towards God Himself, accompanied
          by indifference to all spiritual works and occupations, practised for the
          purpose of preserving this warmth. If a man recollects himself at once and
          hastens to re-establish his habitual warmth-producing order, this warmth
          returns quickly or not so quickly. But if he pays no attention to it and,
          through being dispersed, infatuated with something or self-reliant, deliberately
          allows himself to linger in this cooling atmosphere, and especially if he
          takes the risk of satisfying in actual deed his non-spiritual tastes resurrected
          by it, his very zeal for spiritual life becomes undermined, if not completely
          deadened. The latter is the forerunner of falling into former habitual sins,
          which will not fail to overcome the negligent. But if a man recollects himself,
          he has no difficulty in returning to his spiritual state, even from there.
        cn: 正如心中充满属灵的温暖令人心满意足，这份温暖的缺席也同样苦涩、疲惫且令人恐惧。此前已经提及，当人的专注与心灵偏离属灵之事，转而投向非属灵之事时，这份温暖便会消逝。此处所指并非罪恶——因为一个尝过属灵温暖滋味的人，已不再被罪恶所吸引——而是指所有魂与肉的领域，那些虚妄的、属世的、受造之物。一旦专注倾向于这些，属灵的温暖便会立即减退；但若心也依附于它们，这份温暖便会完全撤离，留下对一切神圣之事和对上帝本身的冷漠，并伴随着对所有为维系这份温暖而进行的属灵工作和操练的漠不关心。如果一个人立刻回省自身，并迅速恢复他那惯常能生发温暖的秩序，这份温暖便会或快或慢地回归。然而，若他对此置若罔闻，因心神涣散、沉迷于某物或自恃而刻意允许自己流连于这种冷却的氛围之中，特别是当他冒险以实际行动去满足因此而复活的非属灵趣味时，他那对属灵生命的热忱便会受到动摇，甚至完全泯灭。后者是坠入往日习惯性罪恶的先声，这些罪恶必将征服那疏忽之人。但如果一个人能回省自身，他即便从那里也能毫不费力地回归到他的属灵状态。

        en: This is how cooling always happens; it is always through our own fault,
          since it is produced by weakening of attention and of watchfulness over
          oneself. This weakening is caused either by the temptations of a man』s worldly
          surroundings, when forms of worldly prelest stupefy a man and abduct him
          from his own self; or by the wiles of the enemy, who contrives to induce
          a man to come out of his inner self, which the enemy sometimes succeeds
          in doing, merely by adding his own more attractive pictures to the natural
          flow of images of fantasy, and sometimes by somehow affecting also the body.
          But, whatever the cause, the action of cooling begins with attention coming
          out of the inner depths, and its further progress is established by the
          heart cleaving to something, at first vain and empty, and later passionate
          and sinful. And in every case it is a man』s own fault. For neither the world
          nor the devil can violate man』s freedom; they can only subject it to temptation.
        cn: 冷淡的发生，总是循着这样的途径；这总归是我们的过失，因为它源于我们对自己注意力与警醒的减弱。这种减弱，要么是受制于世俗环境的诱惑，当世间的「prelest」（世俗的魅惑）使人迷惘，并将其从自身中掳走时；要么是由于仇敌的诡计，他设法引诱人脱离其内在自我——有时仇敌仅仅通过在自然涌现的幻想图像中增添其更具魅力的画面，便能得逞，有时则以某种方式影响身体。然而，无论起因为何，冷淡的行动始于注意力脱离内在深处，其进一步的发展则在于心神依附于某物——起初是虚妄空洞之物，继而变为情欲炽盛且罪恶之物。在每一种情况下，这都是人的自身过失。因为世间与魔鬼都不能侵犯人的自由；他们只能使其遭受诱惑。

        en: Sometimes cooling is due to the action of grace. In its true aspect, spiritual
          warmth is the fruit of grace present in the heart. When grace comes, the
          heart is warm, when it goes-it is cold. Grace also leaves a man, when he
          comes out of himself attracted by wrong things. Then this cooling is and
          is called punitive. But sometimes grace withdraws of its own accord, for
          the purpose of assisting the spiritual progress of the servants of God.
          And in such cases this withdrawal is and is called instructive. But in this
          instance the consequences are still the same-cooling, a sensation of emptiness
          in the heart; for the guest and visitor has gone. The difference between
          these coolings is that the guilty cooling weakens the very zeal for spiritual
          life, whereas cooling due to an instructive withdrawal of grace makes it
          burn with even greater fervour, which is also one of the purposes of such
          withdrawal.
        cn: 有时，心灵的冷淡是恩典运行所致。就其真实面貌而言，属灵的热忱是恩典居于心中的果实。恩典降临，心便火热；恩典离去，心便冰冷。当人被错谬之事吸引，离弃自身时，恩典也会随之而去。彼时，此等冷淡便被称为惩罚性的冷淡。然而，有时恩典也会自行退隐，旨在助益上帝仆人的灵性进益。在此等情况下，这种退隐便被称为教诲性的退隐。但即便如此，其后果依然相同——心灵冰冷，心中空虚之感油然而生；因为那尊贵的宾客与访客已然离去。这两种冷淡的区别在于，因罪咎而致的冷淡会削弱对灵性生命的热忱本身，而因恩典的教诲性退隐而致的冷淡，却会使其以更炽烈的热情燃烧，这也正是此类退隐的目的之一。

          you are anxious for the return of spiritual delights, but rather because

          useless; drink willingly your cup of bitterness, saying to the Lord: 『See

          what he attacks, and say to him with holy indignation: 『 Out of my sight,
          Satan, father of lies. I refuse to listen to you; with my whole soul I believe
          and have always believed in what my mother, the holy Church believes. And

          to the Scriptures: 「If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave
          not thy place』 (Ecclesiastes x. 4). Be vividly aware, and keep this awareness,
          that this is nothing but the guile of the devil who strives to confuse you
          in the last hour. If you cannot stand firm in your mind, keep alert in desire
          and feeling, do not let them incline towards the suggestion, even if it
          is served up under the cover of texts from the Scriptures, which the destroyer
          of souls introduces. For whatever text of the Scriptures he may remind you
          of, he does so with the aim of leading you to perdition by a distorted interpretation
          and perversion of the true words of God.'

          切莫接纳任何不信的念头，并且要坚定不移，正如圣经所言：「君王的心若向你发怒，你不要离开你的本位」（传道书 10:4）。要清晰地感知，并持守这份感知：这不过是魔鬼的诡计，他竭力在最后的时刻使你混乱。若你的心思无法坚定，便要保持警醒的愿望和感受，不要让它们倾向于那引诱，即便它以毁灭灵魂者所引入的圣经经文为掩护。因为无论他提醒你圣经中的哪段经文，他都是为了通过扭曲的解释和对真理之神言的歪曲，将你引向灭亡。

        en: The second temptation in the hour of death, by which the enemy strives
          finally to strike us down, is fear at the memory of the multitude of our
          sins. This fear cannot be avoided; but it is mitigated by belief in the
          redemption of our sins by the death on the cross of Christ our Saviour.
          The enemy obscures this faith and fans the fear of our sins, so as to stifle
          all hope of salvation and strike us down with hopelessness and despair.
          So, my brother, prepare yourself beforehand to repulse this attack, and
          resolve even now to grasp firmly in your hand our victorious standard- the
          cross of Christ, when you approach the gates of death. In other words keep
          firmly in your heart the faith in the redeeming power of our Lord』s death
          on the cross. If, entering the gates of death, you actually experience attacks
          of hopelessness, hasten to realise, first of all, that they are works of
          the enemy, and not the natural results of the recollection of your sins.
          This recollection brings humility, contrition and heartfelt grief at having
          offended the just and merciful God; therefore, although it brings fear,
          this fear does not extinguish the hope of God』s mercy, and being mixed with
          it, produces a daring trust in salvation, removing all sense of being cast
          out. If you know this, you will always recognise, as coming from the devil,
          every recollection of sins, which has the power to oppress and cast you
          into despair, extinguishing all hope of salvation and striking you down
          through fear of being cast out. Once aware of this it will not be difficult
          for you to have hope beyond hope, which will banish all despair.
        cn: 在死亡的时刻，仇敌竭力给我们致命一击的第二个试探，是对我们众多罪孽的回忆所产生的恐惧。这种恐惧是无法避免的；但因着信靠我们的救主基督在十字架上的受死救赎了我们的罪，它便会得到缓解。仇敌蒙蔽了这份信心，煽动我们对罪的恐惧，以期扼杀一切得救的希望，并以绝望和沮丧将我们击垮。所以，我的弟兄啊，你当预先做好准备，抵御这次攻击，即使是现在，也要下定决心，当你临近死亡之门时，将我们胜利的旗帜——基督的十字架——牢牢握在手中。换言之，你要将主在十字架上受死的救赎大能之信，坚定地存留在心中。如果，当你踏入死亡之门时，你确实经历了绝望的攻击，请首先迅速意识到，这些都是仇敌的作为，而非你回忆罪孽的自然结果。对罪的回忆带来谦卑、痛悔，以及因冒犯了公义慈悲的上帝而产生的心痛；因此，虽然它带来恐惧，但这恐惧并不会扑灭对上帝慈悲的希望，并且与希望交织在一起，生发出一种大胆的得救信赖，除去一切被弃绝的感觉。如果你明白这一点，你就会总是认出，凡是那些有能力压迫你并使你陷入绝望、扑灭一切得救希望、并因惧怕被弃绝而将你击垮的罪孽回忆，都是来自魔鬼的。一旦你意识到这一点，你就不会难以拥有超越希望的希望，这希望将驱散一切绝望。

          in your soul, strive with zeal to stifle it and pacify the heart, lest this

          troubled, but to use every effort to keep it peaceful and calm. Seeing your
          efforts and endeavours, God will send you His grace and will make your soul
          a city of peace. Then your heart will become the house of comfort as is
          allegorically expressed in the following Psalm: 『Jerusalem is builded as
          a city」 (Ps. cxxii. 8). God has required only one thing from you, that every
          time you are disturbed by something, you should immediately restore peace
          in yourself, and should thus remain undisturbed in all your actions and
          occupations. You must know that this requires patience; for just as a city
          is not built in a day, you cannot expect to gain inner peace in a day. For
          gaining inner peace means building a house for the God of peace and a tabernacle
          for the Almighty, and in this way becoming a temple of God. You must also
          know that it is God Himself Who builds this house in you, and without Him
          all your labour will be in vain, as it is written: 「Except the Lord build
          the house, they labour in vain that build if (Ps. cxxvii. 1). You must know
          too that the main foundation of this peace of heart is humility and avoidance
          of actions, works and occupations which bring worry and care. As regards
          the first-who does not know that humility, peace of heart and meekness are
          so closely related that where one is, the other is too. A man whose heart
          is at peace and who is meek is also humble, and a man who is humble in heart,
          is also meek and at peace. This is why our Lord joined them indissolubly
          together, saying: 『 Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart』 (Matt.
          xi. 29). As regards the second, we see its prototype in the Old Testament,
          namely, in the fact that God wished His house to be built not by David,
          who spent almost all his life in wars and tribulations, but by his son Solomon,
          who, by his name, was a peaceful king and fought no one.'
        cn: 你当恒常留意，莫让你的心神激动或烦乱，而要尽一切努力使其保持平和与宁静。上主看见你的努力与勤恳，便会赐予你祂的恩典，使你的灵魂成为一座平安之城。那时，你的心便会成为慰藉之所，正如以下诗篇所寓言的：「耶路撒冷被建造得如同京城一般」（诗篇
          122:3）。上主只向你要求一件事，那就是每当你被某事所扰时，你应立即在自身中恢复平静，并因此在所有的行动和事务中保持不受搅扰。你必须明白这需要忍耐；因为正如一座城池并非一日建成，你也不能期望在一日之内获得内在的平静。因为获得内在的平静意味着为平安之主建造一所房屋，为全能者建造一座会幕，并以此方式成为上主的圣殿。你也必须明白是上主亲自在你里面建造这所房屋，没有祂，你所有的劳苦都将是徒劳的，正如经上所写：「若不是上主建造房屋，建造的人就枉然劳力」（诗篇
          127:1）。你也必须明白，这心神平静的主要基础是谦卑，以及避免那些带来忧虑和烦恼的行动、工作和事务。至于前者——谁不知道谦卑、心神平静和温柔是如此紧密相连，以至于有其一便有其二。一个心神平静而温柔的人也是谦卑的，一个内心谦卑的人也是温柔而平静的。这就是为何我们的主将它们不可分离地结合在一起，说道：「你们当学我的样式，因为我心里柔和谦卑」（马太福音
          11:29）。至于后者，我们可以在旧约中看到它的原型，那就是，上主希望祂的殿不是由大卫建造，大卫几乎一生都在战争和苦难中度过，而是由他的儿子所罗门建造，所罗门以他的名字而论，是一位和平的君王，不与任何人争战。

          kindled* (Luke xii. 49). Love for God has no measure, just as the beloved
          God Himself has no bounds nor limits. But love for one』s neighbour must
          have its bounds and limits. If you do not keep it within the right limits,
          it may turn you away from the love of God, cause you great harm and cast
          you into perdition. You must indeed love your neighbour, but your love must
          not cause harm to your soul. Do all your works in a manner simple and holy,
          with nothing in view, except to please God; and this will protect you from
          any false steps in actions dictated by love for your neighbour.
        cn: 主在福音书中曾说，他来是要将爱的火焰掷于我们心田的土地上，而他那极大的愿望便是这火焰能迅速燃起（路加福音 12:49）。对神的爱是无涯的，正如我们所钟爱的神本身亦无边无界。然而，对邻人的爱却必须有其界限与分寸。若你未能将其维系于正确的界限之内，这爱便可能将你引离对神的爱，为你招致莫大的损害，甚至使你堕入沉沦。你固然必须爱你的邻人，但你的爱绝不可伤及你的灵魂。愿你以纯朴而神圣的方式，完成你所有的作为，眼中除了取悦神别无他求；如此，这便能护佑你，免于在出于对邻人之爱的行动中误入歧途。

          of your neighbours. But these actions are often interfered with by injudicious
          zeal, which brings nothing but harm both to your neighbours and yourself.
          Be an example of sincere faith and of a life pleasing to God, and, like
          the Apostles, you will be the fragrance of Christ, drawing all men to follow
          Him. But do not importune all people indiscriminately with your words, for
          in this way you will only destroy your peace with others and in yourself.
          Have an ardent zeal and a strong desire for everyone to know truth in the
          same degree of perfection as you have it, and to be intoxicated with this
          wine, which God has promised and which is now given by Him without price
          (Isaiah lv. 1). This thirst for the salvation of your neighbours you must
          always have; but it must arise from your love of God, and not from ill-judged
          zeal. God will Himself plant such love for your brethren in your soul, when
          it has renounced all things, and will come in His own time to collect its
          fruit. But you must not sow anything of your own accord; all you have to
          do is to offer to God the earth of your heart, free of all tares and thistles,
          and He will sow the seed in it, how and when He wills. This seed will bring
          fruit in its proper time.

          55:1）所陶醉。这种对近邻救赎的渴慕，你必须恒常怀有；然而，它必须源自你对神的爱，而非出于不当判断的热忱。当你的灵魂舍弃一切时，神自会在你心中栽种此般对弟兄的爱，并于祂所定之时前来收取其果。但你切莫自作主张地播种任何事物；你所当行的，乃是将你心田奉献予神，使其洁净，无有稗子与荆棘，而祂将按其意愿，于何时、以何方式，将种子播撒其间。此种籽将于其合宜之时结出果实。

          such rules to themselves, are usually in a hurry to complete the reading,
          not concerning themselves as to whether the heart is touched by it or not,
          or whether spiritual thoughts and contemplations arise in the mind; and
          when they fail to finish the reading, they are agitated and worried, not
          because they were deprived of the spiritual fruit of reading, which they
          need in order to create a new man in themselves, but simply because not
          everything was read. Listen to what St. Isaac has to say about this (ch.
          30): 『 If you wish to gain delight in reading texts and understand the words
          of the Spirit you utter, brush aside the quantity and number of verses,
          so that your mind could be absorbed in studying the words of the Spirit,

          to a lofty understanding of them and is thus moved to praise of God or to
          sorrow that profits the soul. Slavish work brings no peace to the mind;
          and anxiety usually deprives the reason and understanding of the power of
          taste, and robs the thoughts like a leech, which sucks life from the body
          along with the blood of its members.』'

          rewarded His saints with radiant crowns. So, remembering this, do not lose
          courage in the trial you have met. And, as in any other trouble, look up
          to the Lord and say to Him from your heart: 『 0 Lord my God! Take care of
          Thy servant, and let Thy will be upon me. I know and profess that firm is
          the truth of Thy words and Thy promises are not false. I put my trust in
          them, and stand unwavering on Thy path.」 Blessed is the soul which thus
          surrenders itself to the Lord each time it experiences trouble and hardship!
          If, in spite of this, the struggle persists and you cannot harmonise and
          unite your will with the will of God as quickly as you would wish, do not
          grieve or lose heart, but continue to surrender yourself to God, and bow
          down willingly to His decisions-and through this you will gain victory.
          Remember the battle, which our Lord Christ had to fight in the garden of
          Gethsemane, when His human nature, at first horrified by the cup to be drained,
          cried: 『 0 my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me 『; but
          later, coming back to itself and putting its soul in the hands of God, said
          from its full and free will, and with deepest humility: 『 nevertheless,
          not as I will, but as thou wilt』 (Matt. xxvi. 89).'
        cn: 那些追随神道之人，常会经历一段时期，他们所钟爱的圣洁平安、甜美内在的宁静与自由，会受阻而消退；有时，内心的波动会扬起层层尘埃，使他们无法看清所当行的道路。当你碰巧经历此类境况时，须知这是神为你的益处所允许发生的。这正是神以光辉冠冕嘉奖圣徒的属灵争战。因此，铭记于心，莫在所遇试炼中丧失勇气。并且，如同任何其他困境一般，仰望主，并从心底向祂祷告说：「哦，我主我的神！请看顾你的仆人，愿你的旨意成就在我身上。我深知并宣认，你话语的真理坚定不移，你的应许绝无虚假。我将我的信赖置于其中，坚定不移地站立在你的道路上。」每当灵魂经历困苦艰难时，若能如此将自己全然交托于主，便是蒙福的！即便如此，若争战持续不休，你无法如愿迅速地与神的旨意和谐统一，也莫要悲伤或灰心，而要持续将自己交托于神，甘愿顺服于祂的决定——如此你便能得胜。请回想我主基督在客西马尼园所必须经历的争战，当时祂的人性起初因那将要饮下的苦杯而惊恐，呼喊道：「父啊，若是可行，求你叫这杯离开我」；但后来，祂恢复过来，将自己的灵魂交托于神手中，便以完全自由的意志，并怀着最深的谦卑说：「然而，不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思」（马太福音
          26:39）。

        en: 'Our enemy, the devil, rejoices when our soul is in confusion and our
          heart in agitation. So he uses all his cunning to try and perturb our souls.
          The first means in these attempts is to excite self-love, resulting in withdrawal
          of the grace, which creates and pre serves inner peace. For this purpose,
          he suggests the idea that all things which are and appear good in us, are
          acquired by our own labour and diligence and, banishing humility and simplicity,
          disposes us to put a high value on and ascribe great weight to ourselves,
          and to feel ourselves something important, shrouding in forgetfulness the
          action of Divine grace, without which no one can even say the Lord』s name,
          as St Paul testifies, saying: 『No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but
          by the Holy Ghost』 (I Cor. xii. 3). This grace is given to all believers
          and its presence is a sign that a man is a true believer. Having received
          it, a believer no longer does, nor can do, anything truly good without its
          help; it remains always with him, according to the Lord』s promise, and the
          enemy can do nothing with him, while it is in him and encompasses him. So
          the enemy』 strives by all possible means to make it withdraw, and the first
          thing he does for this end, as was said, is to suggest self-appreciation
          or feelings that we are not nothing, but something, and something not without
          importance. To him who accepts such suggestions, the enemy offers a new
          idea, consisting in being sure that he is better than others, more zealous
          and more rich in works. Having succeeded in implanting this opinion, the
          enemy thereupon leads a man to judge and despise others, which is invariably
          followed by pride. All this can take place in the heart in the course of
          a single moment; but even so, the action of grace is immediately reduced,
          which results in inattention to oneself, weakening of zeal, and arising
          of thoughts, at first empty, and later passionate, which is followed by
          the stirrings of passions themselves, and is indissolubly connected with
          a storm raging in the heart-Inner peace is lost. Such a state is not permanent,
          and if the sufferer remembers himself, he returns to himself, and is filled
          with contrition, repents and by prayer reestablishes his habitual inner
          order. The enemy is banished; but he does not lose heart, and returns again
          and again with the same suggestions for the same purpose-to destroy inner
          peace.'
        cn: 我们的仇敌，那魔鬼，当我们的灵魂困惑不安，内心激动不已时，他便欢欣雀跃。因此，他会运用一切诡计，试图扰乱我们的灵魂。他首次尝试的方法便是煽动自爱，这会导向恩典的消逝，而恩典正是创造并维系内在平安的源泉。为此，他会灌输一种观念，使我们相信自身所有美好的事物，无论是已然存在的还是显现出来的，都源于我们自身的劳作与勤勉。他驱逐了谦卑与纯朴，使我们倾向于自我抬高，赋予自身极大的分量，并自视甚高，将神圣恩典的作用抛诸脑后。然而，没有这恩典，无人能呼唤主的名，正如圣保罗所证实的：「若不是被圣灵感动，也没有人能说『耶稣是主』」（哥林多前书
          12:3）。这恩典赐予所有信徒，其存在是人成为真正信徒的标志。信徒一旦领受了它，没有它的帮助便无法，也无法再做任何真正美好的事；它将永远与他同在，正如主的应许，而当它在他里面并环绕着他时，仇敌便对他无能为力。因此，仇敌竭尽一切可能使这恩典退去，而他为此所做的第一件事，如前所述，便是暗示自我欣赏，或是我们并非一无是处，而是有所作为，且并非无足轻重的感受。对于接受这些暗示的人，仇敌会提出一个新念头，即确信自己比他人更好，更有热心，也更丰盛于善行。成功植入这一观念后，仇敌便会引导人去评判和蔑视他人，这必将随之而来的是骄傲。这一切都可能在瞬间发生于心中；即便如此，恩典的作用也会立刻减弱，导致对自身的疏忽，热心的衰退，以及思想的滋生，起初是空虚的，继而是充满激情的，随之而来的是情欲本身的涌动，并与心中肆虐的风暴密不可分——内在平安尽失。这种状态并非永恒，如果受苦之人能忆起自身，他便会回归本心，内心充满悔恨，痛改前非，并通过祷告重建其惯常的内在秩序。仇敌被驱逐了；但他并不气馁，会一次又一次地带着同样的暗示卷土重来，只为达到同一个目的——摧毁内在的平安。

          are chiefly experienced by such men as abandon themselves with particular
          zeal to the service of God, and give special attention to avoiding all things
          that may offend Him;-and they experience them not in the beginning of their
          conversion to God, but when they have worked for Him for a considerable
          time, when their heart is sufficiently purified by holy prayer and contrition,
          when they have felt a certain spiritual sweetness, warmth and joy, which
          made them consecrate themselves wholly to God, and when they have already
          begun to do so in practice. Neither do we see that sinners and people addicted
          to the vanities of the world and of daily life ever have such experiences
          or are subjected to such temptations. This clearly shows that such bitterness
          is an honorable and precious food, to share which the Lord invites those
          He loves best, and even if its taste is not pleasant at the time of eating,
          yet it brings us great profit although this is not then evident. For when
          the soul is in this state of dryness, when it tastes this bitterness and
          suffers temptations and thoughts the mere memory of which makes one tremble,
          it poisons the heart and almost kills the inner man. But, when the soul
          finds itself in this state, it learns to distrust itself and not to rely
          on its own good state, and so acquires true humility, which God so much
          wishes us to have. Moreover it then becomes inspired with a desire to acquire
          a most ardent love for God, a most diligent attention to its thoughts and
          the greatest courage to endure such temptations without harm and comes out
          of this struggle with 『 senses exercised to discern both good and evil』
          (Heb. v. 14) as St. Paul said. But since these good fruits are hidden from
          the sight of the soul, I repeat, it is troubled and flees from this bitterness,
          for it does not wish to be deprived of its spiritual comforts even for a
          short time, and regards every spiritual exercise not accompanied by them
          as wasted time and useless labour.
        cn: 确实，他或许已经从这个事实中获得了慰藉：这些境况主要是由那些特别热切地投身于事奉上帝、并格外留意避免一切可能冒犯他之事的人所经历的；他们经历这些境况，并非在他们初次归向上帝之时，而是在他们为他劳作了相当长一段时间之后，当他们的心灵已通过圣洁的祷告和忏悔得到充分洁净，当他们已感受到某种属灵的甘甜、温暖和喜乐，这使他们全然将自己奉献给上帝，并且已在实践中开始这样做之时。我们也不曾看到罪人以及沉迷于世俗和日常虚华的人，有过这样的经历或遭受过这样的试探。这清楚地表明，这种苦楚是可敬而宝贵的食粮，主邀请他最爱的人分享它；即使在品尝时其滋味不甚愉悦，它仍能给我们带来巨大的益处，尽管那时并不显而易见。因为当灵魂处于这种枯干的状态，当它品尝这种苦楚并遭受试探和念头时——仅仅是回忆起它们都令人战栗——它会毒害心灵，几乎扼杀内在之人。但是，当灵魂发现自己处于这种状态时，它学会了不信任自己，不依赖于自己的良好状态，从而获得了上帝如此期望我们拥有的真正谦卑。此外，它那时会受到激励，渴望获得对上帝最炽热的爱，对自己的思想最勤勉的关注，以及最大的勇气去承受这样的试探而不受伤害，并从这场挣扎中走出来，如圣保罗所言，带着「心窍习练得通达，就能分辨好歹了」（希伯来书
          5:14）。但是，由于这些美好的果实对灵魂的眼睛是隐藏的，我重申，它感到困扰并逃避这种苦楚，因为它不愿即使短时间地被剥夺属灵的慰藉，并将每一次没有它们陪伴的属灵操练都视为浪费时间和徒劳无功的劳作。

          and self-display, to hold fast to his own opinions and decisions and always
          to want everyone to give him a much higher value than he actually has. This
          self-appreciation and high opinion of oneself are extremely harmful in the
          work of spiritual endeavour, so much so that even a shadow of them is enough
          to prevent a man from reaching true perfection. Therefore, in His wise dispensation
          for us all, and especially for those who have sincerely abandoned themselves
          to His service, our loving Father in heaven allows temptations to assail
          us, so as to bring us to a state in which we can easily escape this terrible
          danger of self-appreciation, and are almost compelled to reach a truly humble
          knowledge of ourselves. He did this with the Apostle Peter by letting him
          deny Him thrice, in order that he should realise his own weakness and not
          rely on himself. St. Paul had a similar experience when, after being ravished
          to the third heaven and shown the ineffable divine mysteries, God made him
          endure a certain wearisome and troublesome temptation, so that he should
          bear in himself this indication of his own impotence and nothingness and
          so progress in humility and boast only of his weaknesses, lest the magnitude
          of the revelations granted to him by God should make him puffed up with
          pride, as he himself testifies: 『 And lest I should be exalted above measure
          through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn
          in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted
          above measure」 (II Cor. Xii. 7).'
        cn: 为了让你更深刻地领悟，所有试探皆由上帝为着我们的益处而降下，请细心聆听我的阐述。人堕落的本性，倾向于骄傲，钟爱自我荣耀与炫耀，执着于自身的见解与决断，并总渴望他人赋予自己远超其真实价值的评价。这种自我赞赏与自视甚高的心态，于灵修的道路上危害至深，即便一丝一毫的影子，亦足以阻碍人抵达真正的圆满。因此，我们天上的慈父，以其对我们众生的智慧安排，尤其为那些诚心献身于他事奉的人们，允许试探侵扰我们，好使我们能轻易地摆脱这自我赞赏的可怖险境，几乎是被迫地达至真正谦卑的自知之明。他曾如此对待宗徒伯多禄，任其三次否认他，旨在令伯多禄认清自己的软弱，不再倚赖自身。圣保罗亦有类似的经历，在被提至第三层天，领受了不可言喻的神圣奥秘之后，上帝仍使他承受某种疲惫而烦扰的试探，为的是让他内心常存自身无力与虚无的印记，从而在谦卑中长进，并只夸耀自己的软弱，免得上帝所赐予他的宏大启示使他心生骄傲，正如他自己所见证的：「又恐怕我因所得的启示甚大，就过于自高，所以有一根刺加在我肉体上，就是撒旦的使者要攻击我，免得我过于自高」（哥林多后书

          be humbled. In this the Lord shows His loving-kindness as well as His wisdom;
          for by humbling us He makes us derive the greatest benefit from things which
          appear most harmful, since of all things humility is what is most necessary
          and useful to our soul. Thus, if all temptations are given us to teach us
          humility, it follows that every servant of God who tastes these bitter states
          of the heart-dryness, lack of spiritual savour, dearth of spiritual comforts
          in his heart-experiences this in order to learn humility through thinking
          that they were brought about by his own sins, that no other soul could be
          so lacking in all things, or work for God so coldly as his soul, that such
          states only visit those who are abandoned by God, and consequently that
          he too is abandoned and abandoned deservedly. From such humble thoughts
          is born this good: a man, who formerly thought of himself as something,
          and something very important, now, having tasted the bitter medicine sent
          him from above, begins to regard himself as the most sinful man in the world,
          unworthy even to be called a Christian. And indeed he would never have arrived
          at so base an opinion of himself and such deep humility, if he were not
          moved to it by those special temptations and this great sorrowing and bitterness
          of heart. So they are a great mercy, which God shows in this life to a soul,
          which surrenders itself to Him with wise humility, to let Him cure it as
          He wills and by the remedies He alone knows perfectly and deems necessary
          for healing and bringing it to a good state.'
        cn: '因此，上帝出于对我们这种不幸且偏离正道的习性（总是自视甚高）的怜悯，允许各种诱惑临到我们，有时甚至极其严峻，以便我们认识到自己的软弱，从而学会谦卑。在此，主既显明祂的慈爱，也显明祂的智慧；因为祂通过使我们谦卑，使我们从看似最有害的事物中获得最大的益处，因为在万事之中，谦卑对我们的灵魂而言，乃是最必需和最有益的。


          由此可知，如果所有诱惑的赐予都是为了教导我们谦卑，那么，每一位品尝到这些心境苦涩、内心干涸、缺乏属灵滋味、心中匮乏属灵慰藉的上帝仆人，之所以经历这一切，乃是为了通过思想而学习谦卑：他们认为这些境况是因自己的罪而生，世上没有其他灵魂能如此缺乏万事，或像自己的灵魂一样如此冷淡地事奉上帝，并且，这样的境况只会临到那些被上帝离弃之人，因此，他们也同样被离弃，且是罪有应得的被离弃。从这些谦卑的思绪中，生发出了这美好的果实：一个人，他曾自以为是何等人物，并且是何等重要的人物，如今，尝到了那从上而来的苦涩良药，便开始视自己为世上罪孽最深重之人，甚至不配被称为基督徒。事实上，若非那些特别的诱惑以及这极大的悲伤和内心苦楚的推动，他绝不会达到如此低微的自我认知和如此深沉的谦卑。


          因此，这乃是上帝在此生向那些以智慧的谦卑将自己全然交托于祂的灵魂所显现的莫大怜悯，任凭祂照祂所愿，并用祂全然知晓且认为对医治和使其达至美好境况而言所必需的疗法来医治它。'

        en: Besides these fruits, brought to the soul through these temptations by
          impoverishment of spiritual comforts, there arc also brought many other
          fruits. Made contrite by these inner burdens, a man forces himself with
          renewed vigour and zeal to run to God and beg for His speedy help, does
          diligently everything deemed useful to cure the grief of his soul and banish
          the bitterness from his heart, and, to avoid this torment of soul in future,
          makes a firm resolution to walk henceforth on the path of spiritual life,
          paying the strictest attention to all movements of the heart, and to avoid
          even the merest shadow of sin and the slightest negligence capable of separating
          him from God and God from him in any way whatsoever. Thus the grief he considered
          so contrary to his aims and so harmful, becomes for him a spur, inciting
          him to seek God with greater warmth and to avoid more strenuously all things
          incompatible with God』s will. In brief-all sorrows and torments, which the
          soul suffers during inner temptations and the dearth of spiritual comforts
          and delights, are nothing but a purifying remedy; by their means God in
          His loving-kindness cleanses the soul if it endures them with humility and
          patience. And these torments ensure for such patient sufferers a crown which
          is gained only through them, a crown the more glorious the more painful
          the torments suffered by the heart.
        cn: 除了这些由精神慰藉的匮乏所带来的试炼，为灵魂结下的果实之外，还有许多其他的果实。被这些内在重担所痛悔的人，会以更新的活力和热忱迫使自己奔向神，恳求祂迅速的帮助。他会殷勤地做一切被认为有益之事，以治愈灵魂的悲伤，驱除心中的苦涩。为了未来避免这种灵魂的折磨，他下定决心，从今以后行走在属灵生命的道路上，对心中一切的动向都给予最严格的关注，并避免哪怕是丝毫的罪影和最轻微的疏忽，因为这些都可能以任何方式将他与神分离，或将神与他分离。因此，他曾认为与自己的目标背道而驰且有害的悲伤，反而成了他的鞭策，激励他以更大的热忱寻求神，并更努力地避免一切与神旨不符之事。简而言之，灵魂在内在试炼和精神慰藉与喜乐的匮乏中所遭受的一切悲伤和折磨，无非是净化的良药；神以祂慈爱的恩典，借此洁净那些以谦卑和忍耐承受这一切的灵魂。这些折磨为那些耐心承受者确保了一顶唯有通过它们才能获得的冠冕，这冠冕越是光荣，其心所受的折磨便越是痛苦。

        en: It is clear from all this that we must not torture ourselves too much
          or be sorely troubled either by other temptations which assail us from without,
          or by the aforesaid temptations within, as are those who have little experience
          in the matter. For, in their inexperience, they regard what comes from God
          as coming from the devil, or from their own sins and imperfections; they
          take signs of Divine love for signs of Divine wrath, interpret His gifts
          and favours as blows and scourgings, brought upon them by extreme Divine
          displeasure, and regard all they have done and are doing as useless and
          worthless labour and their present loss as beyond repair. For if they believed
          that these temptations bring no loss of virtue, but, on the contrary, greatly
          increase it when the soul accepts them with humility and suffers them with
          thankfulness; if they believed that they are arranged by God』s loving benevolence
          towards us, they would not be excessively troubled and would not lose their
          peace of heart from the fact that they experience such temptations, have
          unseemly and shameful thoughts, and are cold and dry during prayer and other
          spiritual exercises. All this would only make their soul more deeply humble
          before God and would make them resolve in their heart to fulfil God』s will
          in everything they do, since it is only in this way that God wishes to be
          pleased in this world; they resolve too to strive by all means to keep themselves
          peaceful and calm in accepting all things that befall them, as coming from
          the hand of our heavenly Father, from whence also comes the bitter cup they
          have to drain at the present moment. For whether a temptation comes from
          the devil, from other men or is caused by sins, it still depends on God
          and is sent by Him for our good and to turn some other great temptation
          away from us.
        cn: 由此可见，我们实不应过度折磨自己，也不应因来自外界的诱惑，或因前述的内心诱惑而深感困扰，如同那些对此毫无经验之人。因为，在他们的无经验中，他们将源于上帝之事视为源于魔鬼，或源于他们自身的罪过与不完美；他们将神爱之兆误作神怒之兆，将祂的恩赐与眷顾解读为上帝极度不悦所致的击打与鞭笞，并将他们所做和正在做的一切视为无用而毫无价值的劳作，他们当前的损失也无可挽回。因为，如果他们相信这些诱惑不会带来德性的损失，反之，当灵魂谦卑地接受并感恩地忍受它们时，德性会大大增长；如果他们相信这些诱惑是由上帝对我们慈爱的仁慈所安排的，他们就不会过度烦恼，也不会因经历此类诱惑、怀有不雅和可耻的念头、以及在祷告和其他神修操练中感到冷淡和枯干而失去内心的平安。所有这一切只会使他们的灵魂在上帝面前更加谦卑，并使他们内心决意在所做的一切事上遵行上帝旨意，因为上帝只愿以此方式在此世获得喜悦；他们也决意尽一切努力，以平和宁静之心接受所遭遇的一切，视其为出自我们天父之手，正如他们此刻所要饮尽的苦杯。因为，无论诱惑是来自魔鬼、来自他人，抑或是由罪过所致，它仍依存于上帝，并由祂为我们的益处而发出，以使我们免受其他更大的诱惑。

          God, since you have proved unfaithful to Him, you waste time in examining
          how long you had lingered in every transgression, whether you were identified
          with it and had begun to desire it or not, whether you had rejected this
          or that thought or not, and so on. And the more you thus torture yourself,
          the more your spirit is disorganised, and the greater becomes your stress
          and unwillingness to confess your sins. Even if you go to confession, you
          do so with a disturbing fear, and after confession you still find no peace;
          for it seems to you that you have not said everything. Thus you live a life
          that is bitter, disquieted and of little fruit, and you waste much time
          uselessly. And all this happens because we forget our natural weakness and
          lose sight of the attitude the soul must have to God. In other words, we
          forget that when the soul falls into some pardonable sin that is not mortal,
          it should turn to God with humble repentance and hope, and not torture itself
          with excessive sorrow, bitterness and stress.

          falls by God』s leave. For a penitent distress, which so tortures the heart
          and gnaws at it, can never re-establish hope in the soul, if it is not accompanied
          by a firm trust in Divine goodness and mercy. This trust must always fill
          the heart of those wishing to reach the highest degrees of Christian perfection.

          who have entered the path of spiritual life fail to pay attention to this,

          great mercies, which God has shown you personally, and thus reviving your
          love for Him, rouse in yourself a desire to thank and glorify Him; and then
          actually thank and glorify Him warmly from the depths of your soul. Since
          thanking and glorifying God is the highest manifestation of our living union
          with God, if you take your downfall rightly, its fruit will be, with God』s
          help, your rising higher towards Him. This should be kept in view by those
          who are too sorely troubled and tormented by small transgressions, to make
